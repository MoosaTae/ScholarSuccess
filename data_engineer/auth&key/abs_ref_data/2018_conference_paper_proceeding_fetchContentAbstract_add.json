It has been used to solve optimization problem in many applications including Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) problem. MH based algorithm is usually deployed to encounter a multiple peak problem in partially shaded centralized Photovoltaic (PV) system. CS algorithm performs a good result in tracking the Global Maximum Power Point (GMPP) compared to other MH based algorithms. However it still requires a relatively long tracking time to locate the Global Maximum Power Point (GMPP). This paper proposes a new MPPT algorithm by combining CS algorithm with Golden Section Search (GSS) algorithm to cultivate beneficial features from both algorithms. To validate the proposed algorithm, it will be evaluated by using various cases of partial shading. The result shows a noticeable performance improvement compared to original CS algorithm and other MH algorithm. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway is the first high-speed railway in China. It is an important part of the inter-city railway transit network in the Bohai Rim. High-speed railway has the requirements of high smoothness and high stability to the subgrade. However, in recent years, due to the development of the city, ground subsidence caused by overexploitation of groundwater has caused serious threat to the safe operation of high-speed railway. Therefore, it is significant to conduct continuous observation and analysis for the deformation of high-speed railway and the environment along it.In this paper, TerraSAR-X data is mainly used to study the Beijing Tianjin inter-city railwayBeijing section, and the Interferometric point targets analysis (IPTA) technique is applied to process the SAR data, so as to accurately estimate the ground deformation in this region. In addition, the results are verified by combining with the second-level leveling results in the range of the region, and the results obtained by this method have a better estimation of the deformation.The Maximal Information-based Nonparametric Exploration method is used to explore the relationship between the various influencing factors and the deformation of high-speed railway. The reasons of uneven settlement along the high-speed railway are analyzed synthetically by combining the results of deformation with the data of groundwater, geological strata, fault zone, aquifer system and precipitation in the area. This method can quantitatively describe the relationship between the above factors and the settlement point, more intuitive understanding its impact on the settlement of high-speed railway. The results show that during the observation period, serious spatiotemporal non-uniform settlement of the high-speed railway has occurred along it. Then the results of InSAR time series deformation and second-level leveling results are combined, the time series segmentation characteristics of deformation point is studied. Ground subsidence and the decrease of groundwater level has a better response. The increase of the groundwater exploitation quantity, resulting in the decrease of underground water level, leading to the settlement of the area increased. At the same time, the land subsidence has a certain relationship with the compressible layer thickness in this area. Through statistical analysis, the correlation between settlement and various factors are summed up to determine the key areas for settlement monitoring. Provide important decision support for the safe operation of high-speed railway. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The major problem in assigning its properties is the complexity of the air thermal conductivity coefficient calculation inside a ventilated air cavity. National standards and building codes provide design methods for calculating thermal resistance values for non-ventilated air layers depending on their thickness and location in the structure. The procedure of ventilated air cavity thermal design is not correct when its thermal conductivity coefficient is used as for a non-ventilated interlayer. In order to overcome the lack in the adequate design method, an approach utilizing both the finite element and analytical solutions of the heat exchange equation has been proposed in the present paper. In doing so, the formula derived for calculating the equivalent value of the air thermal conductivity in a ventilated air layer takes into account the heat exchange by radiation as a design value. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Such problems often arise due to design of an upper-track structure in railroad engineering, specifically due to design of floating slab track structures in tunnels. The design procedure aims at calculating static and dynamic parameters of a floating slab track structure, that consist of reinforced concrete track slab and a number of nonlinear-elastic elastomeric pads, that supports the track slab. In order to get detailed analysis of the floating slab track structure, the analysis is performed using FE-model in MSC Patran/Nastran software package. FE-model includes rails, railway fastenings, track slab, elastomeric pads and supports. The results of the static analysis are the deflections of the upper-track structure and stress-strain state of the floating slab. The results of the dynamic analysis include transfer-function of the floating slab and evaluation of insertion loss under excitation frequencies of moving trains over different speed. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

At present, the methods of calculating the cable systems are based on a differential formulation. Variational formulations of such problems and the schemes of the finite element method constructed on their basis are proposed.

The motion of the plate is described by three coupled nonlinear differential equations with due account for the fact that the plate is being under the conditions of the internal combinational resonance accompanied by the external resonance, resulting in three modes corresponding interaction to the mutually orthogonal displacements. The displacement functions are determined in terms of linear vibrations' eigenfunctions. The solution of motion nonlinear governing equations was obtained by the utilization of the multiple scales method, so doing the amplitude functions are expanded into power series in terms of the small parameter and depend on different time scales. The influence of viscosity on the energy exchange mechanism between interacting modes was analyzed. A comparative analysis of numerical calculations for the free and forced vibrations cases was carried out. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The article presents the results obtained from the analysis of occupational accidents, which occurred in the years 2008-2014 in five Polish voivodeships: Dolnoslaskie, Kujawsko-Pomorskie, Lubelskie, Lubuskie and Slaskie. The impact of the following features was identified and examined in the paper: the status of the victim's employment, his occupation, age, work experience, and also the preparation of the employee to perform duties at a workplace. 361 occupational accidents were analyzed. On the basis of the conducted cluster analysis, a professional profile of people who are most often injured in occupational accidents in the Polish construction industry was developed. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The boundary value problem of \"free calcium hydroxide\" mass conductivity in dimensionless variables is obtained. Also, in order to obtain a solution to the boundary value problem of mass conductivity, it is proposed to use a combined approach, which consists in the fact that at the beginning of each microprocess an analytical solution is obtained, and then the whole process is gradually calculated on a computer. It should be noted that the method gives good results if it is carried out in conjunction with the Laplace integral transformation method. In addition, the Laplace transform often makes it possible to obtain a solution in two forms: at Fo<sub>m</sub> 0,1 and Fo<sub>m</sub> 0,1, this is the advantage of using this transformation. The solution of the boundary value problem of mass conductivity is obtained, which allows to find not only the profiles of dimensionless and dimensional concentrations of \"free calcium hydroxide\" in concrete thickness, but also makes it possible to determine the value of this value gradient at the phases interface. The obtained solution allows further determining the time of reaching the critical concentration of \"free calcium hydroxide\" at the phases interface, corresponding to the beginning of high-basic components decomposition, and hence moving on to the further stages of study and corrosion processes modeling, which is confirmed by the graphical dependencies presented in the paper. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

A special perturbed motion differential equations system is constructed. The right-hand sides of this system are finite polynomials relative to an independent regularizing variable. This allows constructing a single algorithm to determine the second and higher order perturbations in the form of finite polynomials relative to some regularizing variables that are chosen at each approximation step. Following the calculations results with the use of the developed method, the coefficients of approximating polynomials representing rectangular coordinates and components of the regularized body speed were obtained. Comparison with the results of numerical integration of the equations of disturbed motion shows close agreement of the results. The developed methods make it possible to calculate, by the approximating polynomials, any intermediate point of the motion trajectory of the body. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

An analytical solution of the problem is presented in a static and dynamic formulation. The proposed solution takes into account the elastic, viscous and rheological properties of soils. The pile is considered absolutely not compressible.

It is shown that the existing regulations do not take into account the risks of extreme thermal processes. The method for the events statistical analysis of the extreme temperature realization are presented. The high-resolution statistical studies results of previously unknown regularities of the maximum and minimum temperatures intensity fluctuations evolution in the period from 1973 to 2009 are presented. Quantitative forecasting of tendencies in realization of the maximum and minimum daily temperatures for the period of all life cycle of buildings is shown. These estimates are intended to account for extreme temperature loads in the design of buildings and engineering systems that forming microclimate of premises. The paper first presented quantum regularities of the air temperature variations in the surface layer of the atmosphere obtained by the authors and previously unknown. As an example, the article deals with the statistical analysis of the extreme temperatures variations in Canberra. The graphic materials over the statistical studies of the maximum and minimum temperatures intensity evolution a period of more than 36 years are presented. The results of studies of integral and differential trends into the maximum and minimum temperatures evolution are given. The article deals with the forecast of the warming expected rate in Canberra until 2067. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In classical structural mechanics, there are two types of nodal connections - rigid and simple joints. This separation is used to simplify the calculations of building structures. Methods of calculation of building structures were created based on idealized models. The accuracy of the solution obtained by these methods depends on how closely the physical nodal connection corresponds to its simplified model. To obtain reliable solutions in the calculation of building structures should pay special attention to the correct idealization of nodes. It is known that any idealization leads to a loss of solution accuracy. With the help of modern computers we are able to take into account more specific features of designs in their design models. Evaluation of node stiffness can be performed by experimental methods. The authors see the way to assess the rigidity of the node performing numerical studies using modern CAD as the simplest and promising. Received final design decision will have more credibility and as a consequence have greater reliability and economic efficiency. The approach proposed by the authors to assess the stiffness of the nodes was implemented in the calculations of various designs. For the metal frame, consisting of columns and beams, the authors performed a numerical analysis of the coupling node. For the column support unit on the Foundation, the authors performed numerical studies of two variants of the structural design of the units. The first option is a node consisting of only one base plate. The second-a node consisting of a base plate and low traverse. Numerical studies of the nodes were performed by the finite element method (FEM) using the CosmosWorks calculation complex. The authors found all the nodes to have a finite stiffness; node coupling of beams with the column, performed only through the wall of the beam, has a low stiffness and is actually hinged; the rigidity of the column support unit on the Foundation through the base plate depends primarily on the thickness of the plate. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

A numerical algorithm for deformed scheme calculating based on the stepwise loading of the finite element mast model was proposed. Comparative calculations of the masts selected versions with the use of developed software modules and SCAD and ANSYS software complexes are carried out. Parametric optimization problems of constant mast structures and two-step stiffness, with fixed and variable position of stretch marks were formed and solved. On the basis of the developed two-level algorithm, an effective design of a two-stage mast with an optimal arrangement of stretch marks was obtained. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Two models are applied to the description of behavior of a shell depending on duration of external loading, namely the model of the tangent modulus for pulse action and the model of the elastic modulus for quasi-static influence. Levels of the maximum pressure and impulse are determined for a real-life tank using these models at which a loss of stability occurs for one of the shape of flexural deformations. Critical curves of stability in the maximum pressure-impulse of pressure plane are also developed. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The essence of frequency analysis is in the fact that it can be used in various frequency characteristics of dynamic loads. In order to avoid resonance which leads to the destruction of structures, the frequency range of dynamic load must not coincide within the range of natural oscillations frequencies of structures. The conducted researches allow us to speak about influence of pliable connections on frequency characteristics. Therefore, an urgent topic is the study of support constraints' compliance effect on natural oscillations frequencies of building constructions. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The analysis of SSI effects' significance was carried out by two methods with very close results. It indicates the need to account not only the effect of the soil motion on the structure, but also the reverse effect of the structure oscillations on the soil motion. The presence of the inverse effect introduces changes in the soil motion as compared to the free field motion of the ground surface with the same seismic conditions. This leads to the fact that free field motion accelerograms should be adopted to appropriate stress conditions, the depth of the foundation bottom and modified stiffness of the subgrade. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In this regard, the constantly evolving software complexes of numerical simulation provide great opportunities to obtain calculation results close to experimental ones, as well as significantly reducing the time and material costs. In this article, we analyze the results of modelling the reinforced concrete elements behavior with organized pre-cracks under the action of static short-term loads. Simulation is performed with the ABAQUS (version 6.14) software. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

From the constructive-physical side, the architectonic logic can be studied by certain methods of elasticity theory, in particular, by the approximate numerical method of finite elements. The article deals with the algorithm of revealing the architectonic logic of eccentricities on the examples of the plane problem solving of elasticity theory. The formal characteristics of the eccentricity logic in connection with the process of form making are considered. The article describes the action of logic within the historical context of the process of architectural form making development, on the example of the constructivists and deconstructionists schools. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

This article considers the development of an invariant environment for the intensification of the group interaction of various specialists in the process of creating and evaluating solutions for weakly structured problem situations. A system-technical information processing solution has been developed, that takes into account the peculiarity of the thought-activity in the form of representation of graphic and analytical components of the weakly structured problem situation of the interdisciplinary subject area on a single screen. In particular: due to distribution of the thought-activity of various roles during the 'Electronic brainstorming table' in the group session: 'Director', 'Stagehand' and 'Experts'. At the same time, a 'Stagehand' (Urban developer) is a mediator or communicator who has the skills of using the stagehand support environment for the 'Strategic techno-theatre' (STT) solutions, 'Experts' (representatives of 'Power', 'Business', 'Society' and specific 'Individuals'). The use of the developed software allows accounting for and generalizing the interests of various urban development stakeholders in the use of the ground, underground and above-ground territory. The obtained technical solution can be used by both state and municipal authorities for the formation of urban development policies and the implementation of joint projects, as well as other projects of stakeholders. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

We consider cases of classical hinged support, rigid or elastic hinging, and also a variant of point hinged support. The latter is realized at the nodes during the FEM model of the plate. It was established (apparently for the first time) that within the last variant of the boundary conditions, at sufficiently strong longitudinal shortening of the plate, first a \"pre-soliton\" equilibrium appears (the appearance of lateral \"half-dents\" on the surface of the extreme half-waves) which turns into a single soliton-like ejection of bending deformations as a result of a load large decrease under conditions of kinematic loading. With the classical hinged support, the lateral sides of the plate remain rectilinear, as a result of which the soliton does not form; the \"pre-soliton\" equilibrium appears. If the plate has a rigid hinge fixation, the monotonic development of the post critical equilibrium will be interrupted by jumps of the load at the secondary symmetrical points and unstable bifurcations. In this case, no effects of localization and soliton formation were observed. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The important condition for the analysis of the stress-strain state by computer simulation is verification with experimental studies. This research is a confirmation of the reliability of the partitioning of the model into finite elements, the choice of their size and configuration. Modeling of three-layered enclosing structures with overall dimensions of attic overlappings allows obtaining strains and deformations in the outer and middle layers at different levels of loads and performing their comparison with limiting values. Due to the high rigidity of the three-layered enclosing structures with a monolithic bond of the layers and the use of structural concrete in the outer layers, the strength of which is more than 10 times higher than that of the middle one, there are no cracks in the operating loads. In order to recommend considering the stress-strain state, there are more dimensional three-layer coating plates with monolithically bonded layers with different geometric and strength parameters, with different degrees of reinforcement and levels. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

At the present time, only few of such investigations have been carried out by scientists. In the present paper, the results of scientific tests implemented by the authors for holding temperature 50\u00b0C and 60\u00b0C are outlined. Dependence between relative strength of concrete specimen cylindrical form and the total time of electrical curing at fixed duration of temperature rise and cooling has been figured out. The scientific experiments implemented have shown that the mode of thermal treatment 3 + 5 + 3 of high-performance self-stressing self-compacting concrete with the temperature of isothermal time 60\u00b0C allowed obtaining the value of relative strength at axial compression of 70%. Along with that, strength of concrete at 28 days corresponded to the concrete grade B80. The obtained data can be used to verify results of calculations. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Computer-aided design systems, such as MathCad, Mathematika, AutoCad, etc., allow solving various problems on the formation of surfaces. The AutoCad system has significant advantages, because it has a built-in functional language AutoLisp, which has functions for mathematical calculations and for drawing different objects in 3D space. In this paper, a method of forming the surfaces of regular polyhedra in an AutoCAD environment through the use of programs in the language of Autolisp is considered.To demonstrate the method, a dodecahedron (Plato's body), a large dodecahedron and a small star dodecahedron (Kepler-Poinsot bodies) are selected. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

They are matched by displacement and deformation at each loading stage of the models.

In the article the arch stress-strain analysis of symmetric and asymmetric loads and the comparison of the new design with the classical one are studied. The most rational position of the struts of the new arch is established by varying their geometric parameters. The calculation of arches is performed taking into account the compliance of joints, and consumption of building materials for the production of structures is determined. As a result of research it is established that the use of a new design of the arch allows to reduce the bending moment in the top chord that results in the general decrease in consumption of wood for the production of an arch. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Based on the design assumptions and theoretical studies outcome, structural elements and structural units of the monolithic reinforced concrete buildings are defined; the destruction of them occurs primarily in the event of failure of the vertical supporting structure and leads to the evolution of progressive collapse. A computational and theoretical analysis has been performed to determine the ultimate deformation effects or load values according to those criteria that determine the bearing capacity of the core units of monolithic reinforced concrete systems of different spans. It is proved that as a basic criterion to estimate the stress-strain state of the monolithic reinforced concrete structures in view of the failure of a vertical bearing system there can be adopted relative deformation value corresponding to the formation of a 'fracture' zone of the near-support slab section under the action of transverse forces. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Engineering method for unsteady-state moisture regime calculation using discrete-continuum method based on Gagarin's moisture potential was proposed. A new formula for moisture potential determination in any section of single-layer enclosing structure, at any time, under continuous control for temperature distribution, was derived. Separate methods of moisture potential theory: Gagarin's method, Kozlov's method, and new discrete-continuum method - were compared. Single-layer enclosing structure made of aerated concrete D400 with inner and outer plastering was used as a research sample. It is shown that the proposed discrete-continuum method gives moisture distribution results for the enclosing structure similar to moisture distribution results calculated by Gagarin's unsteady-state method. Results can be obtained by a finite formula without numerical method. It was found out that the discrete-continuum method takes moisture transfer response rate into account. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The contact layer is considered as a transversally anisotropic elastic medium with such parameters that it can be represented as a set of short elastic rods that are not connected to each other and are normally oriented to the contact surface. Such an assumption makes possible to obtain an analytical solution of the problem presented in a closed form.

The external anthropogenic effects include additional static and vibro-dynamic loads caused by ground and underground transport, changes in urban planning and geotechnical situation, as a rule, during joint underground and high-rise construction. The internal effects include sign-alternating (headed and non-headed) influence of aggressive sewage waters and, consequently, structural corrosion and beyond-limit decrease of its bearing capacity during long-term exploitation. The paper gives real practical examples and shows that pre-limit strain-stress behavior simulation of tunnel collectors under the conditions of combined anthropogenic effects and calculative substantiation of protective measures provide bearing capacity and service reliability during their lifecycle at the stages of reconstruction and use. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Foundation slabs and other massive reinforced concrete structures in the process of their construction experience temperature effects as a result of heat release during concrete hardening. In combination with variable environmental conditions there is an uneven distribution of temperatures in the massive structures thickness, which can cause cracks in the process of concrete strengthening. The heat of concrete is mainly influenced by several factors: the cement specific content, type of cement, water-cement ratio etc. Numerical methods provide the most complete way to estimate thermally stressed state of structures. This paper suggests method of 3-D temperature field calculation for temperature regime estimation of the most typical cast in place reinforced concrete structures (foundation slabs). The influence of sample size, ambient temperature and thermal insulation parameters of the samples outer faces was studied. The program for the ANSYS is developed, which allows estimating the temperature regime of reinforced concrete structures at the early stages of concrete hardening. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The components of GLS system and data obtained during the scanning are indicated. The necessity of processing the data obtained by GLS is pointed out. The main usage of laser scanning which is the obtaining of precise geometric characteristics of an object complemented with any attributive data is stated. Thus, GLS can be widely used in buildings and construction information modeling. Analyzed the range of Russian documents regulating common requirements and developing rules and the usage of information models of massive building objects for applied tasks during different object life-cycle phases as well as usage of contemporary project and survey technology, particularly GLS. The conclusion is made stating on the idea of information modeling supposes its usage containing information characterizes the building object model during the different phases of its life-cycle. In relation to stated facts the role and position of GLS in information model development of a construction site, executive and operational models of an object are pointed out. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Moreover, instrumental monitoring of unique buildings without corresponding correct and adequate so-called \"monitoring-oriented\" models has random nonsensical nature and therefore it is not of practical interest. This paper is devoted to theoretical methodology foundations of structural health monitoring (SHM). In order to review various corresponding approaches, development, modification and verification of parameterized finite building element models, so, significant stage of life cycle (the stages of construction and operation), original algorithm of adaptation (calibration) in accordance with measurements results, methodology of natural frequencies measurements and modal shapes and structural evaluation algorithm are under consideration for each approach. The main criterion for this adaptation is the correspondence of computed and measured spectrum of the natural frequencies and mode shapes in the entire frequency range, significant for the system-wide changes assessment and for possible defects localization. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Rated, equivalent, and tangential stresses values of frame construction on various parts were received during the work. The high efficiency of the wall stiffness intermediate element and section stiffness boundary elements can significantly increase the local resistance elements of thin-walled profile. The possibility of elements strain under the action of the design load is revealed as a calculation result of the finite-element model and taking into account bolted connections in a frame construction joints. The paper contains frame construction overall stability analysis at the decisions of bracing system. The frame construction field tests of 18 m bay from steel thin-walled profiles as a part of three frames block are carried out. As a result, the frame overall stability at the accepted bracing system and local stability of steel thin-walled profiles is provided; the rigidity of a design meets the regulatory requirements. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The results of building calculations are given for different combinations of operating and special loads. The analysis shows that the seismic effect during fire impacts changes the building frame's Stress-strain state: it leads to a change in the dynamic strength and deformation characteristics of the bearing elements of the building, bearing elements, and the fire resistance of the structure is reduced. The reinforced concrete frame calculation of a multi-storey building for seismic load showed that the maximum deformation was: along the X axis, 32.852 mm, along the Y axis - 36.762 mm. According to a building analysis for seismic load (9 degrees intensity) simultaneous with fire impacts, the frequencies of the building's natural oscillations increase by 13.8%. Horizontal movements increase by 1.65 times. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Modern methods of calculating building structures for progressive collapse expect to carry out a calculation with a change in the design scheme. Change of the design scheme is carried out, for example, by excluding one or more elements from it. The calculation of the scheme remaining part for \"viability\" is performed after the removal of the elements. The calculation is realized in the form of an iterative process. Each subsequent result, leading to the some of the elements exclusion from the calculation scheme, increases the amount of the whole system destruction. For today there are recommendations of calculations performance on a progressing collapse in the literature. In practice, engineers have to perform a qualitative analysis of the system to remove elements from the design scheme. In this paper, we present the results for solving this problem for the metal framework of a production building with a spatial structural coverage. Solving the problem, the authors used the calculating applications Lira, SCAD, STAAD, VisualAnalysis and SAP 2000. The modeling of the fracture process was preceded by the possible damage analysis to the coating elements when the source location of ignition inside the building was changed. For the focus of the fire, the rack position for storing the finished products was taken. In order to detect the most dangerous places of fire's origin, the authors used the graphical overlay method of the technological scheme for the construction scheme. In the fires places, areas of structural damage were identified. In this way, the elements (an element) of the construction were determined, which should be removed first from the design scheme. The conducted research of structural design showed that local emergency influence on the majority of structural elements (excluding the nodes transferring the load to the capitals) does not lead to further destruction of the spatial lattice structure elements. The authors confirmed the well-known fact that a redistribution of forces between neighboring elements occurs for statically indeterminate structures in the event of an individual element failure. The calculations showed that the cross-section of the element, selected according to the maximum values of forces, non-accidental combinations is able to withstand the load in an emergency situation. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Therefore, hollow multislot ceramics is very promising material to be applied in exterior walls due to predicted properties thereof and operational reliability. The results of stress analysis and strain behavior of load-bearing wall structures are presented here in, and simulation and strength properties calculation of hollow ceramic blocks are made through SCAD software thereby making geometry parameters for the fracture models. Behavior of Bashkortostan-made hollow ceramic blocks under pressure is found under experimental research of masonries, with the expected fracture process being proposed. Modern software systems are demonstrated to be likely applied for analysis of stress and strain behavior of masonry constructions made of both traditional wall materials and hollow ceramic blocks. Comparative analysis of calculation results is made using PC and \"manually\", with residential high-rise buildings and walls of different thickness taken as an example. Application of hollow wall items in load-bearing exterior and interior walls was confirmed both for high-rise and low-rise construction. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In terms of the strength energy theory, concrete and rebar accumulate potential energy in the section of the construction component under stress; based on the contours of the diagram used in calculation it is possible to distinguish a stress diagram for concrete of the compressed zone. The value of the stress in the section is equivalent to the force used for the deformation of the concrete specimen under stress (prism- or cylinder-shaped); the force is equal to the area used in the calculation of the normable diagram. The calculations of the resolving equations are performed with the hypothesis of flat sections. The conditions of the stress balance in the section of the construction component are tested with the method of the successive approximation. The moment of cracking is calculated in reference to the neutral axis after defining the stress in concrete of the strained zone with the preconditioned accuracy. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "One of the tasks of modern architecture and building is creation of new forms of civil and sport buildings. In world practice it is possible to see the examples of original forms of sport, exhibition, trade and other types of constructions. For creating new complex forms of spatial constructions it is necessary to have equations of middle surfaces of these constructive forms. Certainly, there are many sources of classic literature and articles on geometry of the surfaces including sources in Internet. \"Encyclopedia of analytical surfaces\" was published in 2012, Encyclopedia was published in English language in 2016. 35 classes of surfaces, more than 500 types of surfaces, are described in Encyclopedia. On the basis of the types of surfaces given at the encyclopedias it is possible to form various spatial forms. For the same time it is desirable to have a possibility to create other forms of surfaces. In 2016 the monograph was published. At the monographs vector equation of surfaces with the system of flat coordinate curves is given. Even knowing the law of surface formation, having its equation, it is not always possible to present the type of surface on all areas of change of coordinates at the certain values of parameters of surface. It is therefore important to use program facilities for constructing and visualizing compartments of surfaces. Presently there are many programmatic complexes, allowing reproducing the drafts of constructions, space graphic and surface. One of such complexes is a complex \"MathCad\". In this complex it is necessary to use equations of surfaces in the projections of the Cartesian system of coordinates. But the most comfortable form of equations of surfaces of complex forms are vector equations. Scalar self-reactance equations of complex surfaces usually are very bulky. It is difficult to set the method of formation of surfaces on scalar equations of surfaces of complex form. Vector equations are made with introduction of special additional vector-functions that shows the method of motion a formative curve. Methodology of development of program visualization of surfaces is shown in a complex \"MathCad\" with the use of vector equation. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "This study is aimed at studying computer models that provide a wide range of data in the field of modeling parameters of the internal microclimate of buildings with green spaces inside. The main segment of the study is bioclimatic buildings. There are three main ways to integrate vegetation into such houses: green roofs, green facades, and horizontal plantings in the building. In this article, vertical and horizontal landscaping inside the premises were considered with the aim of realizing the dynamic modeling of such a building. There are two main currents of dynamic modeling: Computational fluid dynamics and Building Energy Simulation. Proper use of energy modeling can help optimize the construction of the building and allow the project team to give priority to investment in strategies that will have the greatest impact on energy savings in the building. These tools allow to achieve maximum accuracy in the urban environment (temperature, wind speed and direction and other characteristics of a given territory are taken into account), modeling of spatial and temporal distributions of bioclimatic parameters, as well as detailed modeling of the building and its parameters (geometry, design, internal conditions, ventilation, HVAC system, etc.) and obtaining accurate energy characteristics of the building. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

There are number demands which stadiums should be met. They arise from level of event, type of event, safety and comfort criterions and features of people flow as a physic-and-social process, and the price is one of the main issues. Some requirements may compete with each other. The only way to verify decisions on people safety and comfort is to simulate pedestrian flow under different scenarios from normal to emergent. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "In most structural problems the object is usually to find the distribution of stress in elastic body produced by an external loading system. The theory of elasticity is a methodology that creates a linear relation between the imposing force (stress) and resulting deformation (strain), for the majority of materials, which behave fully or partially elastically. This paper is devoted to combined semianalytical and numerical static analysis of three-dimensional structures. The stress-strain or constitutive behavior is given for isotropic materials. Solution of multipoint (particularly, two-point) boundary problem of three-dimensional elasticity theory based on combined application of finite element method (FEM) and discrete-continual finite element method (DCFEM) is under consideration. The given domain, occupied by structure, is embordered by extended one within method of extended domain. The application field of DCFEM comprises fragments of structure (subdomains) with regular (constant or piecewise constant) physical and geometrical parameters in some dimension (\"basic\" dimension). DCFEM presupposes finite element mesh approximation for non-basic dimensions of extended domain while in the basic dimension problem remains continual (corresponding correct analytical solution is constructed). FEM is used for approximation of all other subdomains. Discrete (within FEM) and discrete-continual (within DCFEM) approximation models for subdomains and coupled multilevel approximation model for extended domain are constructed. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "More than 300000 earthquakes occur worldwide every year. The main goal of the earthquake-resistant design of buildings and structures in earthquake-dangerous regions is to assure the safety of people and the security of material assets. Significant damage or even complete collapse of buildings are not uncommon because of the inadequate strength of their structural framing elements and connections. The modern approach in the theory of seismic design is in the avoidance of using brittle materials in construction, as well as in regarding as acceptable a local damage that does not lead to the collapse of the entire structure. Often when designing a reinforced concrete building, an engineer is mainly concerned with a strength of a structure, while not paying enough attention to its ductility and ability to absorb the energy. Construction of buildings and their connections based on the structural composite steel fiber concrete in earthquake-dangerous regions is very promising due to the superior ability of this material to resist to static and dynamic loading, which could be controlled by an engineer. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Special analytical method for determining tangential tension stresses in reinforced concrete structures operating in conditions of complex resistance -torsion with bending is proposed in this paper. Its peculiarity consists in the approximation of rectangular and any complicated cross-sections of reinforced concrete structures with the help of their division into squares with the circles inscribed there in, connected together into a single monolithic figure. The dependence of tangential torsion stresses becomes valid on the distance to the centre of the circle under consideration within each j-th circle. The further the circle from the centre of the rectangle is located, the greater its moment of inertia becomes and the maximum stresses are reached in the middle of the rectangle the long sides. Such model makes it possible to remove the question of the necessity using of special tables also for their calculation in the elastic stage. Also it makes possible to separate the stress-strain state in a whole set of circular sections from the additional field associated with the deformation of the rectangular section. The authors corrected and significantly supplemented the dependencies for taking into account the deplanation of a rectangular cross-section rod. Attention is focused on the physical essence of longitudinal displacements caused by deplanation, an analogy with elementary movements caused by shearing forces is carried out. In the study, the classification of spatial cracks for reinforced concrete rod structures under the action torsion with bending was generalized; while the process of spatial cracks formation of the first, second, and third types is tied to the proposed method for determining tangential stresses (angular deformations) for complex cross-sections. The proposed dependencies allow us to search for the values of the model design parameters at of the stress-strain state stages of the reinforced concrete rod structure, including in the plastic and in the limiting stages. The components of the torsion stress (angular deformations) are again synthesized and separated by the proposed method for the convenience of analysis in principal stresses tensors (main strains). Transformational transitions from a cylindrical to a Cartesian coordinate system and the attraction of local coordinate systems made it possible to simplify the equations as much as possible. Moreover, the equations are constructed in such a way that the resolving system does not turn into a decaying system. The physical interpretation of the solution obtained, with respect to the problem of crack resistance, is that it allows us to search for the minimum generalized load that corresponds to the formation of the first, second or third spatial crack types and the coordinates of their formation point. As a result, the effectiveness of the proposed method is shown with approximating rectangular and complex cross sections of reinforced concrete structures under the action torsion with bending and taking into account physical nonlinearity, deplanation of cross-sections, pre stressing in longitudinal and transverse reinforcement and the influence of local stress fields. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The analysis results of peak positive and negative wind loads acting on the enveloping structure are presented. The stress-strain state of the skywalk facade fixture unit in the elastic strain stage is analyzed. Maximal values of force influence on the plastic deformation of the fixture unit components arise. They are determined on the basis of a nonlinear analysis. The object of the research is a skywalk between the Hyatt Regency hotel building and the Iset Tower high-rise building in Ekaterinburg that is being designed currently. Simulation models and computational experiments were made in ANSYS CFX software complex. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The topical problem of investigation, development of numerical and analytical methods to research constructions, buildings and structures is stress-strain analysis of building structures with intricate shape of the boundary. Geometrically nonlinear shape of boundaries (notches, crosscuts) determines the occurrence of stress concentration zones, deformations with significant enormities and gradients. Theoretical analysis of stress-strain state (SSS) for angled cut-out zones of area boundaries under the action of ruptural forced deformations resolves itself to study the singular solutions of uniform problem of elasticity theory with degree type features. The novelty of the research in the present work is determined by the fact that SSS near the vertex of angled cut-out zones of area boundary is characterized by limit strains, similar to the stress-intensity factors KI, KII, KIII when applying force criteria in mechanics of damage. Two-dimensional Betti formula is used to determine the intensity factors as limit strains, for the area constrained by the contour-circle of small radius r = \u03f5. The independence of the Betti integral from the integration path is taken into account, which allows us to consider the contour integral along the length of arc close to the circle r = \u03f5. The limit strains obtained in angled cut-out zones of area boundary are analyzed depending upon the area cut apex angle and the eigenvalues of elastic problem for the case of boundary conditions homogeneous for stresses. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Foam concrete is used as an effective heat-insulating material. This material becomes hard in the natural conditions and has a significant shrinkage that leads to deterioration of the porous structure and as a result of it, increases the thermal conductivity of the material. One of the actual solutions to this problem is the use of mineral modifying additives that regulate the porous structure of foam concrete. A number of such additives were used in this work: wollastonite and diopside (industrial wastes) with natural dispersion and with specific surface of 300 and 600 m<sup>2</sup>/kg. Besides that, instead of fly ash in foamed concrete the use of perlite microspheres was researched in this work. The proposed new compositions for the production of foam concrete products with mineral additives provide the reduction of the thermal conductivity coefficient to 41-43% in comparison with the control. When the fly ash aggregate is completely replaced by perlite microspheres, the coefficient of thermal conductivity is reduced to the level of 0.062 W/(m\u00b0C), but the advanced price of this filler does not allow to recommend it for the mass use yet. Thus, with the introduction of modifying mineral additives, a significant improvement in the stability of the foam concrete structure is achieved, which contributes to the thermal conductivity reduction of the material and to the achievement of the technical and economic effect. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Radon and its progeny in the indoor air form the biggest part of the human annual individual dose obtained from all sources of ionizing radiation. The greatest amount of radon enters into the building from the soil base, so the building degree of radon safety is determined by the underground walling shape. Mathematical modeling is the most effective tool used for the description of a multifactor process of radon entry from soil air into the buildings. The dominant mechanism of radon transportation into the soil and walling materials is the basis of any model of the radon situation formation in the building. Diffusive and advective (convective) transport mechanisms can dominate or make a significant joint contribution to the radon transport in certain conditions of the \"ground-atmosphere-building\" media system. Insufficient information about the magnitude and action direction of the large number of radon transport factors make it possible to simulate the radon entry under the limited conditions of the one transport mechanism dominance. The article deals with the approach to the assessment of the required radon-protective properties of underground enclosing structures under the assumption of stationary diffusion transfer of radon in porous media. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Prediction and simulation of large shells construction parameters in heterogeneous soil milieu provided considerable expansion of the rational use area of megapolices underground areas for deep transport facilities and engineering infrastructure. Mega sizes of an RC shell allow creating open underground areas, unique in volumes and deepness. The analysis of massive gravitational fencing shell behavior at its gradual increasing and driving into heterogenenous soil milieu allowed identifying the nature of their non-linear and unsteady one. Unsteadiness of the massive structure interaction processes and soil milieu causes the necessity to create methods for strain-stress behavior control of the system \"gravitational large body - heterogeneous host medium\" for decreasing aggravating influence of the unsteadiness effect on the lowering process. Due to joint step-by-step implementation of geotechnical and structural calculations a history of the shell-soil milieu interaction processes is modeled and the adaptive control parameters of strain-stress behavior are predicted, thus providing conditions of controlled lowering. The paper demonstrates results of the given concept implementation during the unique underground structures of St. Petersburg sewage system design and construction. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The purpose of the work is to create a method that would enable consideration of environmental safety requirements at the stage of design of the size range of the building products line. Method simplicity is based on the assumption of linear correlation of building products use parameters and required environmental parameters. Existing lifecycle assessment methods are intended for the analysis of one-off products rather than a set (line) of similar unified products. The problem is that the known product lifecycle assessment methods and line product configuration management methods yield mutually exclusive results. This work proposes the data presentation method that combines graphic construction of a parametric series of unified products and graphic construction of environmental requirements to products and their manufacturing and operation techniques. The work uses the known map imposition method as an environmental assessment method. Imposing a layer with graphic information about interrelated design and operational parameters of a product on a layer of information on acceptable exposure of these products manufacture and operation processes helps the product designer choose parameters of the unified product that meet environmental requirements from a host of options. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In particular, terraced boards and other construction materials are made from them. Since terraced boards are often used outdoors, it is necessary to study in detail the effect of moisture on the change in color of products, their water permeability, the ability to withstand UV radiation, etc. In the work, terraced boards produced by the domestic company Savewood are investigated. The matrix polymer was polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The studies were accompanied by theoretic studies of water permeability. The relationships describing water permeability of polymers are given. These ratios include the parameters of the chemical structure of polymers. Experiments on the influence of climatic effects are performed with the help of modern instruments at positive and negative temperatures. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In many cases, the nonlinear differential equations right-hand sides' linearization is extremely difficult or even impossible. Then piecewise continuous and piecewise linear approximations of nonlinear differential equations can be used. The piecewise continuous linear differential equations can improve piecewise linear differential equations by increasing the number of separate linear differential equations systems areas and thereby reducing errors on the borders of these areas. The matrices of piecewise continuous linear differential equations system for steady-state points are estimated using nonlinear model time responses, nonlinear programming and random search method. The proposed approach application results are presented. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In case the pile limited equilibrium is achieved while constructing, additional loads will transfer to the surrounding piles. The process can be stopped until the necessary number of piles reaches the limited equilibrium. To determine the real pile behavior in the condition of the limited equilibrium 45 static pile tests under the maximum load 120 000 kN applied in skyscrapers constructing process in Russia were summarized. Tests analysis makes it possible to estimate the value of the limited and residual skin friction for different soil conditions. FEM analysis results show the soil and foundation behavior in the process of piles part reaches the ultimate equilibrium. According to the researches result, the approach to the optimal pile foundation design was made. The sphere of its implementation and practical significance were also considered. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "The complexity of recent numerical calculations is steadily growing because of the desire to obtain more reliable forecast results taking into account the complex processes of deformation of the ground base in complicated ground conditions and considering the use of modern construction technologies. The phenomenon of creep refers to such complex processes. Its occurrence can be taken into account using a creep-based model, for example Soft Soil Creep, which is a part of the PLAXIS software package. The article provides verification calculations that allow determining the degree of comparability of the samples behaviour in the calculation model and real soil base samples, methods for correcting the results of laboratory tests. An example of a numerical simulation of the construction of an underground structure is given, which shows the significant effect of creep on the deformed state of the substrate after a long period of its operation. Using the example of a single barrette, it was shown that taking creep into account under the lower end leads to a redistribution of the external load along the lateral surface, additional mobilization of frictional forces, which leads to a change in the operation of such an element as a whole. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

It was shown that a dispersed mineral admixture significantly influences on the hardening of cement paste. To obtain the maximum strength, the optimum quantity of additive is 7%, it gives an increase in the strength of hardened cement paste by 22%. It was shown that when the limestone is added, there are significant changes in the structure of hardened cement paste. The number of pores with a diameter less than 1.2 microns increases, the total pore volume and the total pore surface also increase. This enlarges the characteristic length of pores and reduces the tortuosity of pores. In a cement paste with no admixtures, the structure is loose enough, with a large number of shrinkage pores with a size of up to 0.05 mm. The hardened cement paste with admixed dispersed limestone has a denser, more homogeneous fine-crystalline structure with a small quantity of pores in all investigated periods of hardening. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

        "abstract": "Computer simulation of hydroelectric units is impossible without calculating vibrations of their assemblies. The permissible oscillations are determined by the norms. The existing norms do not meet modern requirements. In the article there are presented problems of evaluating test results according to the existing norms. Firstly,the operating frequency band of the sensor on the vibro-displacement parameter does not cover the frequency range 0.1-200 Hz. There is no such vibrating sensor. We cannot get technically a complete picture of the vibration state of the hydraulic unit and according to the norms determine its evaluation. Therefore, the frequency band 0.1-2 Hz is proposed to be monitored separately by pressure pulsation sensors. The norms of permissible pulsations are required for this procedure.Secondly, the sensor resonance is in the frequency band of the structure. Thirdly, the frequency band to be monitored is not specified in the norms. Possible errors in estimating oscillations are revealed in the article. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

It should be mentioned that in order to obtain the reliable results of modeling, it is necessary to verify the model; this verification is achieved based on the statistical data on the operation of a water supply system. For model calibration, foreign software complexes apply the programs based on genetic algorithms. At the same time, the analysis of Russian software products reveals the absence of such functions. The aim of this article is to describe the algorithm operation of the electronic model of a water supply system using a genetic algorithm by the example of a network taken from technical literature. The developed automatic calibration algorithm is applicable to Russian software \"ZuLu\". \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Heat losses reduction in buildings deemed as end-use energy consumers is one of the most promising directions of energy saving. The aim of this analysis was the calculation of thermo technical characteristics of multi-storey residential building with reinforced concrete frame by simulating external walls using ANSYS software. 25-storey residential building with reinforced concrete frame in Ufa, the Republic of Bashkortostan was taken as the subject of research. Values of specific heat loss were obtained through the structural units and enclosure, on the whole, being reviewed, comparative results between calculations of main thermo technical characteristics of framed building was assessed by ANSYS software and by simplified table method as per SP 230.1325800.2015. Analysis of the air space inside the wall affecting specific heat loss through the junction with floor slab (perforation filled with heat insulation) has indicated that the air space inside the structure do not actually influence the heat loss for the low density blocks. Application of current software complexes like ANSYS is demonstrated as likely to be used for detailed scientific analysis of the possibility to increase enclosures thermal homogeneities. ANSYS may be used together with reference tables for specific heat loss for the junction between perforated floor slabs with the filler wall considering the air space inside it. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Approximations of the mesh functions in discrete Haar bases of zero andfirst levels are described (the mesh function is represented as the sum where one term is its approximation of the first level, and the second term is so-called complement (up to the initial state) on the grid of the first level). Special projectors are constructed for the spaces of the original grid vector functions to the space of their approximationon the first-level grid and its complement (the detailing component) to the initial state. Basic scheme of the two-grid method is presented. This method allows boundary problems solution of structural mechanics with the matrix operators' use of significantly smaller dimension. It should be noted that discrete analogue of the initial operator equation (defined on a given interval) is a system of linear algebraic equations which is constructed with the use of finite element method or finite difference method. Block Gauss method can be used for direct solution. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The simulation technique algorithm and the automated program are constructed in such a way as to be a kind of experiments' catalogue (database) carried out on a universal hydraulic bench. The program content and the requirements to input and output information are presented herein. The results of an automated processing of the experimental data are given in the form of tables and graphical dependences, which characterize the liquid gravity flow regime depending on the degree of the pipelines roughness made of different materials. The target of the program is to provide a wide application of its results by the designers as tool in their design works when designing gravity water discharge lines, as well as in construction, modernization and renovation of pipeline transport facilities focusing on the trenchless repair methods. The program has a special unit, which assesses and compares domestic and foreign methods of hydraulic calculations of pipe lines through the roughness coefficients determined by the formulas of Manning and N.N.

        "abstract": "The operation of reinforced concrete wall panels with holes used in civil engineering has been studied. Under conditions of plane stress wall panels operate in vertical (q<sub>y</sub>) and horizontal (q<sub>x</sub>) evenly distributed loads conditioned by the own weight of the panels and pressure of the overlying overlap and covering structures. The effect of wind load on the building develops the flexural state of wall panels, i.e. loading the structures with the transverse evenly distributed load takes place. To study the stress-strain state of the above-mentioned structures, the work proposes a rod approximation in the form of a rod of a step-variable cross section, taking into account the presence of a hole in the body of the wall panel. Using the numerical finite-difference method there one solved the initial fourth-order differential equation for the compressed-bent state of the deformed rod. The results are presented in the form of the diagrams of transverse, axial and angular displacements, bending moments, longitudinal and shear forces diagrams. The results of the studies are of scientific and practical importance. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The introduction shows the relevance of the determination processes the accordance between numerical and mathematical models and numerical and physical models accepted for calculation. As an example, methods for calculating multicomponent joints of wooden structures on glued steel flat rods pasted into wood are considered, and structural nodes solutions of wooden trusses on these type connections are given. The second paragraph describes the features of finite element models creation for calculating the stress-strain state of the glued joint of flat rods with wood when they are pulled out with rigid nodes in the conjugation zone of finite elements from various materials and when contact surfaces are created in this zone. A mathematical solution of this problem, reduced to the plane deformation problem for finite canonical domains, is considered. An analytic solution of this three-dimensional problem, reduced to the plane deformation problem for finite canonical domains, is considered. The mathematical solution is based on obtaining functions that are biorthogonal to the Papkovich-Fadl eigenfunctions. The calculation results comparison of the stress-strain state of the finite element model of the steel flat rods' glued joint with wood, the analytical solution and experiment are given. On the basis of verification and validation it was shown that the proposed approaches to the construction and calculation of the glued joint of steel flat rods with wood can be reasonably applied to determine the stress-strain state and the design of the wooden structures nodes. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

It was revealed that the protective structures research on the effect of the damaging factors complex of weapons modern types was not carried out. The results of a study on the rice husk ash use as a component of a composite binder are presented. To achieve the purpose of the work, an organomineral nanomodifier was developed with the following composition: 32% of cement, 31% of ash, 17% of quartz flour, 14% of crushed limestone, 6% of hyperplasticizer. The modifier was ground to a specific surface area of 500-900 m2/kg. It was added to cement in the amount of 1, 3, 5, 7, 10%. Water was added in the amount necessary to ensure the same mobility. Cement stone was studied at the age of 1, 3, 7, 28 days. Curves of strength were constructed. It was found that rice husk ash (amorphous and porous) obtained at a burning temperature of 600 to 700\u00b0C (using the appropriate combustion method) has the potential for use in structural concrete due to the pozzolanic properties of such rice husk ash. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The behaviour of the fragment imitating the steel-reinforced concrete work section on the basis of a beam with a zone of equal deformations is considered. The load was applied to two beam nodes at a distance of 0.5 m from the support, thus forming a zone of pure bending at the site of the slab's inclusion in the beam work. The inclusion in the work of precast hollow-core slabs is provided by the installation of stud anchor on the slab's ends welded to the upper flange of the beam, while the length of the support plates increasing. Based on finite element analysis, carried out engineering and theoretical studies, the authors obtained dependences describing the behaviour of steel-concrete composite slabs. The analysis of the results showed good convergence of the finite element analysis results and theoretical solutions. The discrepancy between the results of finite element analysis and theoretical methods was less than 5%. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

Differential equations represent one of the variants of the basics of a mathematical model. If linear differential equations do not cause difficulties, the nonlinear ones will present a serious problem for a researcher due to the appearance of movable singular points. Such differential equations are related to the class of equations generally not solvable in quadratures. This fact actualizes the problem of the approximate methods development to solve this category of equations, since the existing classical methods are very often turned out to be ineffective. This paper presents the development of an analytical method for approximate solutions of nonlinear differential equations with movable singular points. The formulation of the emerged tasks is given as well as the technique of their solution. The obtained theoretical material is tested by numerical experiments confirming the reliability of the results. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In the foundation of problem algorithmization it is put principle of initial structure dividing to substructures, combination of numerical and analytical methods at multistage calculation. Determination of critical force in compressed reinforced concrete elements of chosen substructure is carried out combining the initial parameters method and the displacement method. On the energy basis using works values at initial and end section it is evaluated nearby elements influence level on buckling of the most compressed rod. The numerical results of developed algorithm realization for substructure of reinforced concrete frame-bracing structural system of multi-storey building made of panel-frame elements are presented in the paper. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The results of the research made it possible to develop a method for calculating the final settlement of single screw double-blade piles for foundations of lightly loaded prefabricated buildings. The method is based on patented design solution for a screw double-blade pile and takes into account the non-linear dependence of its settlement with the applied external load. The scope of the method application under consideration extends to screw double-blade piles up to 3.0 m in clay soils, mainly from soft to semi-solid consistency. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

In connection with the last point, the authors have conducted a comparative analysis of the wind load distribution by the lens-shaped (lenticular) building case. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The research may be relevant to ensure fire safety and to prevent explosion hazards at industrial production facilities that use reactive gas mixtures as a working medium and at high-pressure industrial pipelines used for their transportation. The goal of the study is to develop a computational technology for numerical modelling of shock waves propagation and to predict loads on civil structures. To describe the chemical processes in the explosion, a simplified mathematical model is proposed which based on the assumption of the infinite speed of chemical reactions. Using the model, a set of User Defined Functions is implemented in ANSYS Fluent and applied to solve a problem of a \"propylene-air\" cloud explosion inside the cavity located in the vicinity of two standalone buildings. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

It is shown that this influence largely depends on various structural and technological factors: (characteristics of the composition of concrete, its structures, water-cement ratio and of the natural moisture content of concrete). The necessity of taking into account these factors of influence in the calculation of reinforced concrete structures on the strength, deformability and crack resistance at the same time power and temperature effects has been justified. Diagrams of deformation of concrete in the frozen to minus 70 \u00b0C condition are developed. Taking into account these diagrams the development of the diagram method is given, which allows to calculate reinforced concrete core structures under simultaneous influence of power loads, and low climatic (to minus 70 \u00b0C) negative temperatures. \u00a9 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",

The proposed FPM seeks to achieve a targeted profit of an investor. A flexibility index is introduced to calculate the flexibility in the EVCF load, and hence determine the extent to which the EVCF is flexible, when equipped with DERs. The DER options considered for reinforcement of the EVCF are-energy storage systems (ESS) and rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation. Case studies considering a 33 bus distribution system are presented and discussed to validate the proposed model. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The multi-objective problem is solved using a goal programming approach with a weight assigned to each objective. The energy storage is modeled to participate in energy arbitrage and provisions for operating reserves to the microgrid. The storage system performance parameters are considered, and its capacity degradation over the planning horizon is modeled. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and demonstrate the storage system investment decisions in different microgrid operational scenarios. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The droop method provides a suitable current sharing in the system because there is no intercommunication link between the parallel-connected modules. However, when the cable resistance is considered, a small mismatch in output voltage of parallel-connected converters leads to circulating current and unequal load current sharing between two modules. To resolve this issue without using a communication link between modules, the modified droop method based on cable resistance implementation is proposed to improve the load current sharing. This can be established by adjusting the output voltage for each converter of the parallel-connected converters individually and according to modified load regulation characteristic of the droop method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using Matlab/Simulink simulations. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In the event of a large scale disaster, where the damage is apparent, electricity consumers tend to appreciate power outages will occur but their tolerance for the duration of an outage less predictable. As North America advances it technological and knowledge-based economies, its dependency on a safe, uninterrupted and reliable source of electricity reduces its patience for extended power outages. Electricity utilities simply do not have the day-to-day resources necessary to meet the disaster restoration expectations of a customer base dependent on uninterrupted power. Disaster mutual assistance in form of regional and national disaster mutual assistance groups has been used and developed by electricity utilities to support each other during major power outages. Effective management of disaster mutual assistance is a challenging task and requires significant preparedness, coordination, collaboration and resources. Electricity utilities impacted by disaster events need to quickly find other utilities able to provide the necessary assistance, determine their availability and for how long they can assist. Recent large-scale electricity disruptions experienced in Canada and the USA show that traditional methods of organizing disaster mutual assistance may be enhanced and by leveraging emerging technologies. This paper describes the background and motivations behind the development of a disaster mutual assistance coordination tool for Canadian electricity utilities. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, the relation between the two VSGs is formed; one is operating as a source, whereas other as a load. This correlation defines the maximum power that can be delivered to the VSG controlled energy storage system (ESS), the influence of a load (static), and the effect of contingency (dynamic) on both VSGs. Furthermore, a unique control is presented to draw the constant maximum power from renewable energy source (RES) by interlinking it with the stable parallel-VSG; without compromising the ability of transient stability to dampen any disturbance. The results are illustrated through power and angular frequency graphs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Estimating appliance specific power consumption using a single measuring device, known as Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), is a challenging Blind Signal source Separation (BSS) problem. For the past two decades, numerous mathematical and pattern recognition techniques, including Fractional Hidden Markov Model (FHMM), Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Mean Shift Based Clustering Techniques (MSBCT) have been proposed to decompose the total power consumption of a household into appliance specific power signals. The measurement sampling rate, operating characteristic of individual appliances and an unknown number of mixed signals create a big challenge in separating them. The main challenge is to design an algorithm that can learn appliance features accurately, before applying the algorithm to disaggregate the main power signals. To address this problem, A Very Deep One dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (VDOCNN) for appliance power signature classification is proposed in this research. As a first step, we have applied VDOCNN in learning appliance features from a given set of labeled training data. VDOCNN has achieved accuracy up to 98% in detecting appliance from its power signature using a UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity (UK-DALE) dataset. Using this algorithm, we are working towards disaggregation of power signatures for different appliances from a single power signal in future research. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Driven by technical challenges and environmental needs, there has been significant interest towards integrating more renewable energy sources (RESs) into the electricity grid. However, the high penetration level of RESs is usually accompanied with a few operating challenges such as voltage variation, reverse power flow, and frequent operations of Volt/Var control devices. To address these challenges, this paper presents a centralized coordinated voltage and reactive power control for a medium-voltage (MV) active distribution network (DN) dominated by photovoltaic (PV) and wind power systems. The proposed model minimizes the operating cost by minimizing the real power loss and reducing the number of OLTC operations while maintaining the network voltage within the allowable limits. The objective is to determine the required reactive power from the inverter based RESs (IBRESs) and the optimal setting of the OLTC. The coordination problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem and solved by GAMS software. The proposed model is validated by a two-feeder MV distribution system connected to a sub-transmission system via a substation transformer. The results show that the proposed model can optimize the operational cost of active DNs. Hence, utility and customer satisfaction can be met. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Transmission systems worldwide were designed predominantly for operation with conventional synchronous generation but are now evolving to include the integration of large amounts of renewable generation. These generators are sited at resource-rich locations, causing a geographical shift in power injections into transmission systems, in some cases, subjecting them to undue stress. In many transmission systems, the capacity to integrate wind resources has been exhausted. In these circumstances, assessing the effect of the uncertainty inherent in wind forecasts with respect to system voltage stability is very important. This paper proposes a method for providing such an assessment. Using an optimal power flow algorithm, a Hessian matrix of the power balance equations is determined, which linearly relates changes in the minimum singular value of the system Jacobian to changes in bus-wise real power injections. This relationship is then employed for examining the effect of the uncertainty in the wind power forecast with respect to system voltage stability. The proposed method has been applied for studying these effects in IEEE 6-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems. The same systems were also investigated using the minimum singular values of the system Jacobian matrix. The comparison of results from two methods demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed technique. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

An SRM is designed as an alternative to a 10-hp induction motor. It is designed to have the same volume so it can utilize the same NEMA frame. Optimization through the number of turns per phase, stator and rotor pole arc angles, and conduction angles is carried out. Selection of conduction angles for the motor drive is based on a multi-objective constrained genetic algorithm optimization to achieve the required torque with the same phase current as the reference induction machine. Thermal analysis of the proposed machine is conducted to demonstrate its suitability for extended continuous operation. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The dc-link capacitors and flying capacitor (FC) voltages, and the output current are controlled simultaneously in one control loop by employing the proposed improved FCS-MPC. In addition, the neutral point current is remarkably reduced by utilizing the proposed controller. Moreover, the cost function of the proposed improved FCS-MPC only consists of the neutral point and FC voltages, and the output current. Three decoupled pseudo functions are defined to predict the dc-capacitors and FC voltages by using only the output current. Hence, the proposed control method does not need to measure the dc-link and FC currents to predict the dc-link capacitors and FC voltages. The performance and feasibility of the proposed improved FCS-MPC for 5L-ANPC converter are verified by the simulation results. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The main contribution of this work is to investigate the relationship between smart cities management and the wastewater coming from the households to waste water treatment plant. It has been shown that the gathered information from the waste water is very useful for identifying the locations of pollution caused by medicaments and drugs in a city. We provide a brief overview of smart cities, followed by statistical information about world's population and the population of cities within Slovak republic. Moreover, the key information about the locations and the times of pollution is briefly discussed. Exploiting the network theory and the tree data structure used in this work, enables one to localize the collection points and to create the infrastructure for automatized collection of data. Compared to previous work, we identify the pollution points more effectively and more economically. Therefore, this makes the solution attractive for criminology of drug distribution points in the city. Subsequently, it leads to cleaner, safer and more environmentally friendly cities. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The paper describes how CSA Z463 can be used by organizations to reduce risks in existing electrical equipment and systems. The impact on worker safety whenever electrical systems are not maintained is also examined. We will discuss key features covered in CSA Z463 clauses which are important in building a solid electrical risk management foundation for workplace safety. These include the electrical maintenance program, electrical systems risk assessment, electrical maintenance strategies, and planning electrical maintenance tasks for execution. The approach that organizations should take in order to establish an electrical maintenance program (EMP) within their overall existing asset management system (AMS) is not covered in this paper. Organizations should however, consider integrating within their AMS the concepts discussed. These concepts support the sustainability of the administration process in managing electrical risks. In addition to improving workplace safety, the CSA Z463 standard provides organizations with opportunities for cost-effective solutions to achieve their safety objectives. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

As charging times of electric vehicles (EV) may be significant, without optimization, customers will wait to get charged without knowing the actual period of charging. In addition, the charging facility will not be aware of optimum charging power levels and the charging time to minimize costs. In this paper, an optimal EV charging method is proposed that minimizes the total cost for a merchant-owned charging facility with multiple chargers. The formulation considers energy costs, demand charge, connected transformer capacity, charger capacities and EV power capacities. The optimal schedule for the day can be determined ahead of time such that the customers can be informed of the cost and charging schedule. This is a complex mixed-integer linear optimization challenge with three-dimensional matrices. In this paper several cases are studied using the proposed algorithm. It is fast and efficient. This methodology would be highly useful for merchant-owned EV charging facilities and it is ready for the industrial applications. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A fuzzy-based controller is developed to utilize the ground heat and the weather conditions for maintaining the temperature in a thermally insulated greenhouse system. The greenhouse system is equipped with actuated windows, fans, sunlight collector and environmental sensors. Results showed the heat exchanger can be used for pre-cooling in summer and heating in winter in hot and imbalanced climate zones like UAE.

Due to practical restrictions on direct measurement of SOC, we try to introduce effective and accurate observing scheme which excel estimation results. The estimation of SOC and SOH has a crucial role in applications involving rechargeable batteries. SDRE observer is an extended form of Kalman Filter (KF) estimator for nonlinear systems. In this paper, the SDRE-based observer has been proposed for nonlinear RC battery model which is widely used. The resulting observer has several advantages including a faster convergence, better accuracy, and simpler structure in comparison with most existing methods. The simulation results show the merits of SDRE filter in estimating of SOC and SOH. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The results of detailed studies performed in the PSCAD/EMTD software environment indicate that inaccurate modeling of the impedances of even short lines, e.g., 20 m cables, which connect DERs to DC buses can cause significant error in simulation results. Based on the performed analytical and numerical investigations, it is shown that even the short cables in the DC microgrid should be represented by series RL branches or PI section models rather than ideal conductors. In addition, it was observed that there is no considerable difference between the results obtained using the RL model and the PI section model of short cables for typical transient, control, protection, and stability studies, i.e., studies that do not involve transients in the frequency range above tens of kHz. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Some of the major relevant modeling tools are also discussed. Furthermore, the paper describes the simulations carried out using multiple test cases incorporating autonomous features of distinct levels. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Still, for an adversary, constructing a least effort attack vector is difficult and known to be L                             <sub>0</sub>                             -norm optimization problem. In this paper, two-fold intelligent approach is proposed to optimally construct the FDIA vector. First, the problem of selecting the vector components is formulated as a constrained nonlinear programming problem and is solved using Genetic Algorithm. Second, a Neural Network is trained to generate in real-time the vector amplitudes. The attack vector is optimally selected in terms of number of measurements to compromise, the set of measurements accessible be the adversary, and flexibility to successfully pass Bad Data Detection algorithm of the state estimator. The performance of the attack vectors is analyzed on the IEEE 14-bus system against AC state estimator for a range of various system loading conditions and considering two attack strategies.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The novelty of this work over other approaches is that the nonlinearities of the AGC system are considered, which make it difficult to use the conventional approaches to detect FDI in case of considering the nonlinearities. The AGC of a two-area power system is used and the results show that the proposed approach succeeded to detect FDI in AGC system with an accuracy of 94%. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Nevertheless, synchronous-based generators, are characterised by their limited reactive power capabilities which could lead to voltage collapse problem during islanding. Microgrids also comprises controllable loads. The majority of modern loads are power-electronic-interfaced and demand voltage regulation at their ends, exhibiting constant power characteristics. Microgrids with high penetrations of constant-power loads are vulnerable to voltage collapse especially during contingencies such as weather-caused outages. To this end, this paper investigates the possibility voltage collapse phenomenon in islanded microgrids during contingencies. The voltage stability analysis was carried out on an islanded 6-bus microgrid. Several case studies were designed in order to reveal the likelihood of voltage collapse in microgrids under extreme events. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In addition, comments are made on the effect of the substation transformer. In the context of this paper, multiple load levels are investigated through a thorough analysis of a sample test system. The effects of the cyptocurrency mine are then quantified through comparison to standards indicated in IEEE Std. 519. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Factory sectors have a large share in global energy consumption; therefore, consuming energy in this section should be controlled and managed. In this study, a smart decision support system (SDSS) framework is applied in a cloud environment. It includes three main stages. The first stage collects data from a smart grid system and stores them in cloud databases. The second stage, which analyzes energy consumption data, is an analytic system including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Sensor Data Regularity-Tree (SDR-Tree) methods. The third stage is a web-based portal for user communication and displays the results on charts. Cloud computing technology presents services for a grid system infrastructure and software, which raises the speed and quality of processes and reduces the costs of storage devices. In the last stage, for speeding up the operations and reducing time response, a Load Balancing Decision Algorithm (LBDA) mechanism is applied in the cloud environment. The main aim of this study is to propose a model combined with two ARIMA and SDR-Tree methods in order to increase the accuracy of the results and solve the problems of both single models. Implementation of this hybrid model is suitable for the electrical energy efficiency improvement and smart factories development. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Two control loops have been used in the control system. The filter reference current is extracted based on synchronous reference frame. Hysteresis current control is employed as the inner control loop for generating switching signals. The DC side capacitor voltage of the APF is maintained by a PI controller. The results show the APF associated with the implemented controller can mitigate variety power quality problems, such as harmonic elimination, power factor correction, and load balancing. The whole CHIL simulation system work stable with high switching frequency. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Moreover, as placement of PQMs is highly dependent on the network topology, the proposed method considers the most probable configurations of the network for optimization. The error of measuring equipment and its effect on number of PQMs is also taken into consideration. The defined objective functions of this study aim to minimize the cost of installing PQMs while minimizing the number of blind-pairs and maximizing the fault-observability level of the network. These objective functions are optimized using Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO) technique. Additionally, to have a better economic evaluation, two scenarios are defined based on the accuracy class of monitoring equipment. The effectiveness of the proposed method is corroborated using simulation results for the IEEE 123-bus distribution test system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The procedure to obtain an effective Q-V curve from measurement data is proposed, and monthly Q-V curves are built. Each Q-V curve is created using the data corresponding to a very narrowly defined real power range so the real power can be considered constant as the conventional Q-V curve concept. The curve fitting tool box in MATLAB is used to realize the required fitting to develop mathematical equations.

Further, full closed-loop models are evaluated in an experimental benchmark for the step response of active and reactive power (P and Q) changes.

In addition, two system grounding arrangements were taken into account with ungrounded and Petersen coil earthed neutral point. In the paper simulative analyses of ferroresonance initiation conditions as well as looking for signals reflecting this phenomenon are described. The phase as well as open delta VT voltages and their spectra were considered as signals for ferroresonance detection.

In this paper, an optimisation algorithm based on Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm is used. Case studies with grid-connected and islanded modes of operation demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimisation algorithm. Also, since the EMS Control Centre is normally at a remote location from the microgrid, a communication system is needed to exchange information between the Master Controller of the EMS Control Centre and the Local Controllers of the various generators. A low-cost communication system has been developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the communication channel required between the Master Controller and the Local Controllers. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The algorithm is useful for facilities where pump speed is a linear function of liquid level in order to transport fluid and smooth inflow peaks. A nonlinearity in the form of a quadratic term is added to the conventional linear one in order to produce efficiency gains, with a single parameter, curvature, varied to optimize energy savings. Results obtained by implementing the new algorithm on a pilot-scale pump station show significant energy savings for fixed pump flow, with a parabolic correlation of specific energy savings versus curvature of the nonlinear quadratic determined. In addition, the cost of implementing this algorithm is minimal to none, so the work presented has major industrial potential. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A significant amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be attributed to projects, mainly construction works. Therefore, projects' environmental impact should be estimated before the project commencement and be monitored during its implementation phase. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to quantify the uncertainty of project GHG emissions using Bayesian networks (BNs) and simulation techniques. The model provides a quantitative risk analysis mechanism to estimate the total emissions of the project as well as an update of the final emissions using information on the completed activates. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, maintaining voltage and frequency in the allowable range, as two main symptoms for proper performance of a power network, is a crucial challenge in islanded inverter-based microgrids (IBMG). In the event of severe contingencies, load shedding (LS) can be the last solution which recovers the voltage and frequency of the system. This study introduces an under voltage-frequency LS (UVFLS) scheme to achieve proper load shedding amounts (LSAs). In this paper, state-space model of IBMG and a fast time-step simulation approach, based on the complete state-space model of IBMG has been equipped, in order to obtain responses of the system. A precise method for calculating P-V curves according to loads PF is presented to derive the optimum LSA. Simulation studies are carried out on a test IBMG in presence using MATLAB software to validate the proper performance of proposed voltage and frequency recovery method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, review on modelling photovoltaic (PV) module/array is established first; next, the combination of the optimization method of maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and Newton Raphson resolution for identifying the five unknown parameters of single diode photovoltaic Module/Array at different types of test conditions is proposed. This predicted method is compared with generalized least square estimator known also as optimization method. It is also compared with popular predictive methods Villalva's and Lambert solution. The proposed method is applied for polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic MSX60 solar module at standard test condition (STC). Two types of comparison are made: First, the dynamic variations of all five parameters values are carried out by graphs and compared in tables with the values found with the other methods (mentioned above); the parameters have converged after up to 150 iterations at STC and the accuracy of estimated parameters is sensitive to the initial parameters of trust region. Secondly, the (I-V) curves are superposed, justifying the accuracy of the proposed method. The comparative errors graphs are also carried out. The results proved the effectiveness of the maximum likelihood estimator, by accuracy parameters of the PV module/array. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Although polynomial interpolation with cubic, quartic or quintic polynomials has been widely used in the literature for motion planning purposes, these polynomials have also some major drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is an insufficient smooth trajectory profile. The other problem is not having adequate equations to solve the problem of using seventh-order polynomials for pre-specified positions, velocities, accelerations and jerks in every specified control points or time intervals during the desired path. Instead, seventh-order or higher-order-polynomials are used to satisfy more boundary conditions to overcome the problem of specifying desired position, velocity, acceleration and jerk at the specified control points. Another method that is used for the trajectory planning, is to use spline interpolation polynomials. A comparison between different methods will be done, and their impact on the overall energy consumption of the system will be discussed. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

As the name implies, DG resources are in general located in a distributed manner near the load centers. Therefore, choosing a proper site for a new DG is a critical step for its long term efficient power generation. In addition, DG siting involves many factors such as economic, social, environment, geographic, availability of electrical infrastructure, etc. Examples of DGs include, solar panels, micro wind turbines, small hydropower units, fuel cells and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). In this paper, we introduce a model using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Fuzzy AHP (FAHP) algorithms to develop a ranking system to choose proper sites for SMR power generation units. We consider electrical and non-electrical loads, existing and retiring generation, transmission lines, switching stations as the location-dependant scenarios for determining suitable locations. We produce more precise results by implementing fuzzy logic based AHP algorithm which deals with the linguistic vagueness and uncertainty of the siting data. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The underlying principle is based on storing electricity as thermal energy in the building envelope and household contents before the grid peak demand period, and then discharging that stored energy to maintain conditions for thermal comfort during the peak period. During January and February 2016, a total of 13 DR interventions were executed. This field test showed that a load shift up to a maximum of 3.4 kW, with an average of 1.4 kW, per household was possible for the first hour, depending on the outdoor temperature. We observed a large variation in load shift between homes, partly depending on the thermostat set-point profiles, building and occupant characteristics. The approach holds significant potential for shifting peak loads in locations where electricity is a major source of energy for space heating. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

While, ideally, the load at each point of the network would be equally distributed among the three phases, this is not the case in practice. The three-phase voltages and currents are thus unbalanced due to the different magnitudes of loads at each phase. The integration of single-phase distributed generation (DG), e.g., photovoltaic (PV) units installed at secondary networks, adds more challenges to the voltage unbalance in distribution networks. This paper investigates through simulations the impact of DG on the voltage unbalance in Canadian benchmark rural distribution networks. The maximum penetration levels of DG that can be integrated into distribution networks are determined taking into consideration the standard limits of voltage unbalance, operating voltage limits, and thermal ratings of the feeder. Different configurations of voltage regulators and DG are studied. Simulation results showed that the voltage unbalance factor (VUF) decreases with the integration of three-phase DG especially when high penetration levels of DG are located close to the end of the main feeder. Up to 24 MW of three-phase DG can be connected to the main feeder, which is 154% of the total peak load, without violating any of the limits. It was also found that the maximum size of a single-phase DG can be at least 3 times the peak load of a given node at any single-phase lateral. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The use of parametric probability density functions, such as the Rayleigh, Weibull and Gaussian distributions, can be problematic as it can lead to model mis-specification at a given site. In this paper, the use of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to estimate wind speed variability is investigated and compared with the above three popular parametric models using wind speed data for six sites in northwest Europe. Results show that the GMM produces the lowest error values with the highest percentage improvements, and is the only model that consistently fails to reject the null hypothesis when conducting the K-S goodness-of-fit test. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The tool exploits structural mapping technique to control 8 geometric design parameters of SRMs. These parameters are yoke thickness, teeth height, teeth pole arc angle, and teeth taper angle of both stator and rotor.

The objective of the OPF analysis in this paper is to minimize not only the losses in the lines and the converters but also the generation cost by using a multi-objective function, which makes the system economically efficient. The constraints of voltages, both of the DC and AC power flows, and the line flows are the parameters that affect the optimization process. The proposed methodology covers both the AC and DC sides of the grid in terms of the lines as well as the DC/DC and AC/DC converter losses. In order to achieve a global optimal solution of the OPF problem, semidefinite programming (SDP) is used. SDP has been tested on an 8-bus system with one DC/DC converter and five AC/DC converters. The result of the optimization process is obtained and a comparison is made between neglecting and including the losses of the AC/DC and DC/DC converters. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Assuring the confidentially, integrity, availability, and accountability of sensitive consumer information, and the safe, resilient, and reliable delivery of critical services, is among the top priorities for governments and utility providers.

Performance of the proposed improved PD droop control strategy is investigated using a detailed and realistic study system, and its effectiveness is verified using extensive simulation studies in the PSCAD/EMTDC software. The study results indicate that the proposed control strategy enables effective voltage and frequency regulation, i.e., limited deviations, in the inverter-dominated microgrid without causing power oscillations between inverters. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper compares the results of concurrent neuro-fuzzy (CNF) technique applied in different power transmission lines (PTL), to predict the detection faults and their location over two long and short PTL (735 kV, 600 km and 400 kV, 120 km), CNF was used for detecting, locating and classifying faults in PTL. The results show that the utilization of this technique for such task could be time saving for the technical team and could improve the transmission line yield. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

On the other hand, in distribution systems, with limited availability of measurements, and additional measurements being expensive, careful selection of location for the placement of meters becomes important. The measurement meters typically considered are phasor measurement units (PMUs) and power (PQ) meters. In this work, optimization based approaches are proposed to address the optimal meter placement problem considering different objectives such as minimization of cost, weighted least square (WLS) residual estimate, and a multi-objective function comprising cost and WLS, and the average root mean square error (ARMSE) of the estimated state vector. The various optimization models are tested on a 33-bus distribution feeder, and compared based on meter placement cost and ARMSE of voltage estimates. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper proposes a modified power mismatch elimination strategy for an MMC-based PV system. Although the existing power mismatch elimination strategy based on internal power flow of the MMC is capable of eliminating power mismatches in a perfectly balanced power system, it will fail to do so if the grid voltage is unbalanced at point of common coupling (PCC). The proposed modified power mismatch elimination strategy, utilizes the internal power flow of the MMC-based PV system to ensure that the converter leg connected to grid phase with higher voltage delivers higher power to the grid and the leg connected to the phase with lower voltage delivers less power to the grid. As a result, the currents delivered to the host grid become balanced and symmetrical in spite of existing power mismatches and unbalanced grid voltage. The effectiveness of the proposed modified power mismatch elimination strategy is demonstrated by time-domain simulations conducted on a model of the PV system in PSCAD/EMTDC software environment. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A mathematical formulation was developed to investigate this objective. Energy Storage (ES) is used to manage islanded microgrids with renewable energy sources. Investment and operation costs of generators and ES are compared to develop the least-cost longterm economic plan. A case study carried out considering a benchmark microgrid is presented to validate the developed formulation. The developed formulation selects the most economical generation or ES assets at optimal sites. If the microgrid has been built for a community where the electricity generated from conventional sources is very expensive, ES is economical to manage the demand and renewable energy supply variations. From cases studies, it is found that most of the battery technologies are economical for the considered ES options. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Solar energy for electricity generation is popular and widespread as it is clean and abundantly found in nature. Partial shading on solar photovoltaics directly affects performance by reducing the power output of the system. As a contribution to further developments in photovoltaic technologies, factors that affect the performance of photovoltaics, under partial shading conditions were studied to improve the technology. Currently available strategies include the use of bypass diodes, Centralized Maximum Power Point Tracking, Distributed Maximum Power Point Tracking as solutions. Comparison of these methods were done and observed that Distributed Maximum Power Point Tracking gave the optimum solution. A DC-DC converter along with a Maximum Power Point Tracker was interfaced at each PV module which enabled the Maximum Power Point to be tracked. In this paper, a novel algorithm is proposed for optimal configuration of solar panels under partial shading conditions. The simulations were done in Matlab/Simulink. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "This paper aims to build a solar forecasting model for the power system operator to allow them to make informed decisions on the electricity market dispatch. Detailed literature review on meteorological and atmospheric sciences is performed to understand the various factors which affect the solar irradiance level. These parameters are classified into four types. The first type is the meteorological parameters which vary with the date and time and the second type is the parameters which depend on the location. Using known equations and existing empirical models, the parameters classified in these two types is determined. The third classification is the parameters which are affected by the weather and this includes temperature and relative humidity. In this paper, statistical prediction method will be used to forecast these two parameters. Temperature and humidity are related to each other and therefore, vector time series is used in the prediction method. Stationary time series data will be used in the ARMA model fitting. The innovation series was found before maximum likelihood and instrumental variable method are used to determine the suitable parameter for the ARMA model. The last classification for this paper is the parameter for the cloud cover. Image processing of satellite images will be used to determine this cloudiness parameter. Solar irradiance is then calculated using the combination of all these parameters. This method is illustrated by using Singapore weather data. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Based on the similarities between the concept of cloud infrastructure and Smart Cities, we can say that the cloud environment is the lower layer in any Smart City architecture, and any improvement in the cloud pricing mechanism and cloud sustainability can be modeled and used in the Smart City concept. This paper will discuss the similarities between the cloud infrastructures and Smart Cities, as well as their respective business models.

        "abstract": "In recent years, a smart house combining renewable energy systems has been rapidly developed. In our laboratory, we develop an algorithm to decide the operation plan of the storage battery introduced in the smart house. In the previous research, we simulated the operation of storage batteries for representative day aimed at leveling power load. From the simulation results on the representative day of the January, April and July, the power load is leveled in each month. Also, the average value of the power demand after power load leveling in one day is defined as the power load leveling line. However, because the power load leveling line differs from each day, it is necessary to investigate the change of the power load leveling line in several days. Also, in predicting power demand for one house, because how to use electricity is left to customers, predicting power demand is difficult. When planning the operation of storage batteries for several days with multiple houses, because the demand power is smoothed by the smoothing effect, it is expected that the power load leveling line will almost unchanged on each days. However, it has not been investigated how much the power load leveling line will change. Therefore, in this paper, we simulate the operation of storage batteries in one house or 20 houses for 3 days and investigate the change of the power load leveling line. Furthermore, this paper shows how the fluctuation width of the power load leveling line by 20 houses can be suppressed more than in one house. The smart house system consists of a storage battery, bidirectional inverter, photovoltaic power generation, and electric demand load, which connected to the commercial power grid. Operation of storage batteries is planned by Genetic Algorithm (GA) analysis method. The simulation period is from 14th to 16th in Kitami City, Hokkaido, in January (winter), April (middle term), July (summer). The data using for simulation is solar radiation data obtained from NEDO, and power demand data obtained from Hokkaido Electric Power. The simulation result shows that the fluctuation width of the power load leveling line for 3 days in 20 houses is smaller than one house, and further the fluctuation width of January, April and July in 20 houses for 3 days can be reduced by 6.6%, 0.2% and 27.3% than one house. We shows that power management is better to control at multiple houses. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Some salient features of this method include its capability to distinguish between fault and partial shading conditions, and its independence from meteorological data. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed on a utility-scale PV array under various conditions. The results verify the scheme's selectivity, sensitivity, high speed, and scalability. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In addition to regulating the system frequency, AGC systems help to minimize the tie-line power deviation in multi-area systems. Given their reliance on communication links in order to send/receive mea-surements/control actions about frequency and power deviation in the power system, AGC systems are vulnerable to false data injection (FDI) attacks. Several works have considered the effect of these cyber attacks on AGC systems and many approaches have been proposed to detect FDI attacks against them. However, non of the previous works considered the nonlinearity of the AGC system and all the proposed solutions are only effective under the assumed linearity of the AGC model. In this work, we address this deficiency and propose a new particle filter-based approach to detect FDI attacks in AGC systems considering both the communication time-delay and governor dead-band nonlinearities. To confirm the effectiveness of this approach, a 2-area power system is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the utilized technique is capable of detecting various types of false data injection attacks against the considered AGC system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The droop control \u03c9-P is basically a decentralized control that defines the frequency variation of a microgrid on the increase in load. The control equation for the equivalent \u03c9-P slope for two VSGs is derived to see the effect of a load on the overall system's frequency. In the parallel VSG system, the power distribution among the multiple VSGs is dependent on the droop control. The correlation of multiple VSGs is presented in this paper that can bring the firm coordination between the different sources in stabilizing the system; by finding the dependency of each VSG on a microgrid. Furthermore, the master-slave control is introduced to acquire the maximum power of one VSG (e.g. solar) by following the instant frequency of a system as a reference, instead of constant reference frequency. Following controls are verified by performing the experiments on an island microgrid system and the results are shown through graphs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Two different auto-regressive models are built as well as one model that includes exogenous variables. All of models use recurrent neural networks (RNN) as their base architecture. The added value of exogenous variables is evaluated by comparing different accuracy metrics cross data set and cross model. The results show, that the autocorrelation of load and PV data sets produce reasonably good accuracies for auto-regressive predictions using RNNs, whereas wind production is far harder to forecast and the RNNs are not able to infer any suitable predictions using only a univariate time series. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Thus, the study carried out in this paper presents a real-time algorithm for cost optimization to achieve Demand-Side Management of a Renewable Energy Source integrated microgrid. The algorithm aims to achieve utility maximization and cost reduction for an optimal power scheduling in the presence of variable loads. The proposed approach mitigates the continuous changes in the variable loads that emulates the load profile found in residential, commercial and industrial users. The particular focus of this work is on developing a decentralized control scheme and a utility-oriented energy community, which provides user satisfaction based on energy management system, production units and load demand. Moreover, the paper presents utility maximization solutions on the combined energy profile of the microgrid targeting two main objectives, i.e., (1) minimizing the aggregate energy cost and (2) maximizing the provider's and user's satisfaction. Minimizing the aggregate energy cost aims to reduce the peak to average ratio of the aggregate energy profile of the microgrid using the cost function for energy cost minimization. The proposed technique is tested on microgrid which is coordinated in master-slave control topology. The implemented algorithm ensures a stable and efficient operation of the microgrid while minimizing the total cost of production. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The proposed power generation system drives the actuator by making use of large pressure difference in the generation and dissociation reaction of CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             hydrate caused by small temperature difference of several tens of degrees. In this study, CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             hydrate generation and dissociation tests are carried out using reaction vessels with different thermal conductivity, and the C02 hydrate generation characteristics are compared by examining the CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             hydrate generation amounts. In addition, an increase in the power generation amount of the proposed system is analyzed. Experiments were conducted to examine the production experiment of CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             hydrate to measure the amount of CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             hydrate production and experiments simulating the proposed system using reaction vessels and buffer tanks. A stainless steel cylindrical device (thermal conductivity 20.9 W/(m\u00b7K)) and a copper cylindrical device (thermal conductivity 402 W/(m\u00b7K)) were used for the reaction vessel. By using two reaction vessels, we investigate the amount of CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             hydrate produced and the efficiency of dissociation due to the difference in thermal conductivity. As a result of the survey, it was confirmed that increasing the thermal conductivity of the reaction vessel increases the CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             hydrate production by about 67% and the CO2 hydrate dissociation efficiency increases by about 1 %. Therefore, as one method to increase the power generation amount of the proposed power generation system, it is possible to increase the thermal conductivity of the reaction vessel.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This work examines the influence of unsteady surface waves on the performance of tidal in-stream energy systems using real data for tidal currents from Minas Passage site, Bay of Fundy, Nova Scotia, Canada. Two concepts are used to test the correlation between waves and tidal currents with two different tools for both types of energy variables. The first concept is the speed of tidal currents. The relationship between the tidal current speed and the maximum wave height is confirmed. The second concept considers the wave direction. For the most cost-effective system, considering the effects of surface waves is needed. Results confirm the distortion effect of unsteady surface wave on the tidal in-stream speed. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Microgrids can be considered as a tool to improve the power distribution system reliability and a platform to integrate renewable energy into the power grid. In the absence of large rotating synchronous generators, often microgrid voltage waveforms are formed by power electronic converters. These converters operate at constant voltage (constant V-f) mode operation when the microgrid is in islanded configuration and operate at constant power (constant P-Q) mode when the microgrid is connected to the main power grid. It is important to understand the performance of converters in terms of managing power balance within the microgrid both when they are connected to the main power grid and at stand-alone. Results of an experiment conducted with a prototype microgrid are presented. The prototype microgrid is purely formed by a three-phase converter bank. It is a three-phase unbalanced AC-DC network with a connected single phase Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), AC load and a DC load. Details of all network elements of the microgrid are included in the paper. By comparing voltage measurements to power flow analysis results, it was concluded that converters could manage the microgrid power balance. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, a new HE strategy with real-time tracking of amplitude and phase angle of each harmonic component is presented. The proposed method employs linear Least Squares (LS) estimator and improved Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) algorithm for phase angle and magnitude estimation, respectively. The proposed method decomposes the harmonics estimation problem into two problems; linear for amplitude estimation and nonlinear for phase estimation. The aim of this paper is to present an efficient and accurate approach for harmonic parameters estimation. Multiple scenarios are considered to evaluate efficiency and accuracy of the proposed technique.

The mathematical models of the three-phase induction motor are implemented in LabViewblock diagram pages. These models are in form of differential equations and Runge-Kutta 4th order method is implemented to solve the problem. LabViewFpga module alongside with Xilinx 10.1 compiler will generate the Bitfiles, and then Synthesize, Route and place the logic gates to a FPGA chip. NI PCI-7831R is programmed to communicate with real system as a data acquisition card. This communication is implemented in real time environment (RTX) through Ardence RTX as a multithread and multitasking software. The presented real-time platform provides a versatile and flexible simulation tool for investigating dynamic behaviors of induction machine in different cases and can be extended to many other equipment and subsystems of electrical power systems. To validate implemented squirrel cage induction motor model and also its behavior in LabViewsoftware, human machine interface (HMI) is developed in LabViewfront page. A study case is simulated in LabViewreal-time system and MATLAB/Simulink, as two independent software. Results show that motor characteristics (i.e. speed, torque, and etc.) are in the close correspondence compared to MATLAB outputs and consequently LabVIEW model is verified. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In the traditional fifteen-level operation, the capacitors voltages have to be maintained around their references using a state variable feedback which requires three sensors, two for the capacitors voltages and one for the load current. By applying the proposed PWM technique to the fifteen-level PUC converter, self-balancing of the capacitors voltages is attained, which results in the proposed nine-level converter. The proposed balancing technique is achieved without any closed loop regulation or sensors. The proposed concept has been verified by mean of simulations performed in the Matlab Simulink environments. Simulation results show that even under severe DC bus voltage and load parameters variations, the capacitors voltages remains around their required values. Harmonics contents of load current depend on the modulating signal frequency. Moreover, even under low frequencies, the total harmonics distortion remains reduced. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The algorithm performance is validated using the three standard test distribution systems, 33-, 69-, and 119-bus networks. Excellent repeatability of results is achieved as demonstrated through comprehensive statistical analysis. The optimal reconfiguration found by the proposed algorithm significantly improves the VSI of the buses most prone to voltage collapse.

These mathematical relations are known as fuel-cost functions, which are the heart of optimization algorithms. These functions could be modeled as first, second, or third order polynomial equations. The first order or linear equation is weak to explain the variability of units' operating cost. Also, the third order or cubic polynomial equation is rarely used in the literature, because its third element does not have any significant contribution to add. Thus, the second order or quadratic polynomial equation becomes the most popular fuel-cost function. Sometimes, different linear equations grouped as a piecewise function are used to accelerate the computational speed and linear programming algorithms can be directly involved. This study tries to achieve the goal of the last approach without using any piecewise function. That is, improving the preceding single linear equation to be a competitive fuel-cost function. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Moreover, the balancing and equalization of stored energy in different storage units presents other challenges in such systems; to deal with this, the paper discuss here the factors that affect energy balancing and the speed of the energy balance convergence. A Proportional-Integral (PI) controller is used in the upper control level to generate an accurate reference value for the State of Charge (SoC), and a modified droop control is employed on the lower control level to equalize the energy on the basis of the SoC.

The long-term reliability of photovoltaic (PV) generators is crucial to ensure the technical and economic viability as a successful energy source. The analysis of degradation and failure mechanisms of PV generator is key to ensure current lifetimes exceeding 25 years. In the present work, brief presentation of components parts, modeling of PV generator and significations or sources of parameters are established first. Next, the analyzing and investigation on relationship between maximum power point and parameters variation are carried out; results from the ARCO Solar M75 array at NOCT prove that changes on maximum power are related to parameters variation. The estimation of the PV generator model parameters could then lead to accomplish a diagnostic tool and to estimate several factors that affect the health state of a PV generator; in this context, fault diagnosis and monitoring method based on parameters is developed; maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is used as method for extracting parameters from the ARCO Solar M75 array at NOCT (in years 1990,2001 and 2010) and then residuals on all parameters are generated for establishing deviation on same parameters for these years; the key role of this method is detecting deviation on parameters, which are tied to state of health of PV generator; results prove deviation on all parameters, that means there is degradations and failure on the ARCO Solar M75 array. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "With increasing renewable energies integrated into power grid, the variability and uncertainty in power system are becoming dramatic and unpredictable. Probabilistic Power Flow was proposed to handle the uncertainties, by introducing random variables with specific probability distributions into calculation. However, the current PPF usually adopts correlation coefficient matrix as its correlation model, which is incomplete for probabilistic modelling. And the deterministic distributions in PPF cannot fully describe the randomness of renewable energy. To address the problem, this paper proposed a fuzzy Copula model for building a more complete and real probability model. And based on the fuzzy model, a whole scheme of Fuzzy Probabilistic Power Flow (FPPF) was established. Case study showed that FPPF can help obtain more possible distribution scenarios of objective random variables, indicating its superior reliability and practicability than conventional PPF. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Due to deregulation of the power system, grid reliability becomes more complicated. Even, day by day small-scale and renewable power generation is inserted in a distribution system effectively due to people awareness. A power transformer is one of the most important equipment in the grid to reliably and efficiently transmit power to the consumers. Asset management and protection are the best concepts for enlargement of transformer lifespan as well as to increase grid reliability. This article reflects on electrical and other parameter based power transformer asset management. Voltage, current, and power based inrush detection and Power Differential Protection (PDP) are applied to protect the transformer. Various data such as load history, losses and temperature will be monitored in real time to enhance the working capability of the transformer. The proposed method adopts various electrical and nonelectrical parameters for condition monitoring. The proposed scheme is successfully tested on SkV A laboratory transformer using Arm CORTEX-M4 processor. A fitness function estimated from the collected data in the processor will reflect the condition of the transformer. The hardware result confirms the effectiveness of the scheme for monitoring and protection of transformer. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

On the other hand, it is known that output fluctuation of renewable energy is leveled by interconnecting renewable energy dispersedly arranged in a wide area [1]. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the cost of the system by optimally distributing and link the renewable energy to a wide area. Therefore, in this study, we developed computer algorithms to optimize the location and introduction amount of renewable energy that will conduct wide area interconnections based on actual transmission network equipment. The target of the analysis was the Hokkaido area in Japan with extensive land and abundant natural energy. Using the proposed algorithm, we evaluate the relationship between economical renewable energy location and capacity, renewable energy supply rate and grid capacity. As a result, it was possible to realize an economical power system with a high percentage power supply ratio of renewable energy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Thus, power system protection plays an important role to prevent these faults and mitigate their consequences. The most significant effect of short-circuit faults is the sudden increase of currents. Thus, overcurrent protection becomes the most widely used technique. Different devices are implemented to achieve that protection, such as: Thermal/electrical relays, reclosers, sectionalizers, and fuses. This paper tries to take the advantages of techniques used in fire and gas (FG) systems. One of these techniques is built based on what is called a linear heat sensor (LHS).

As clouds are moving toward a certain direction, the cardinal orientation of photovoitaic arrays affects the variability of the output power, and thus the impact on the electric power grid. This paper presents a new methodology with a circular layout for irradiance monitoring units to assess the solar variability in different directions of any site based on cloud speed-direction trend and directional variability reduction. The proposed methodology is used to assess the directional variability for a site at Varennes, QC, Canada using 1 year of measured data. The cloud speed direction is studied in order to observe any trend from a month-to-month and from an hour-to-hour. Overall the cloud direction has a trend of West to East direction, especially during the winter months. The variability reduction for each axis is estimated using the variability index (VI). The largest VI reduction is observed close to the cloud direction axis. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive design procedure for the supply side of a stand-alone photovoltaic-based electric vehicle parking lot. For this isolated system, a photovoltaic (PV) array installed at the parking roof is in charge for power supply. Also, a battery bank as a storage system is dedicated to ensure the service continuity. A step down DC/DC converter is providing the required voltage to harvest the maximum available power of the PV array. This converter is fed by the main system DC bus. Another bidirectional DC/DC converter is responsible to maintain the suitable voltage profile at the DC bus, in addition to the battery charging. The last stage of the supply is a voltage source converter (VSC) that is fed by the main DC Bus. All three converters are designed and modelled. Further, the appropriate controller for each converter is suggested. Considering the importance of the VSC output filter, an efficient algorithm for filter design is proposed that offers better trade-off between filtering and damping. Also, a controller is suggested for bidirectional buck-boost converter that guarantees its stable operation for sudden change of PV supply and load, for the whole operating region. The effectiveness of the proposed design procedure is validated through time-domain simulations. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce an energy efficient communication architecture that encourages the use of renewable energy through exchange of power and dynamic access. The base stations (BSs) are often equipped with renewable energy generators, but the random availability of this energy combined with the users' demand heterogeneity, make the use of this energy inefficient. Thus, we propose to improve it through cooperation between BSs by (i) exchanging the energy among them, and (ii) dynamically assigning users and available resources. We formulate an optimization problem that maximizes a generic objective function combining the users satisfaction and the network energy consumption cost. The different degrees of freedom in the system, ranging from assignment of users to BSs, exchange of available energy, and dynamic allocation of the bandwidth are considered while the budget power and bandwidth constraints are taken into account. We show that the optimization problem can be written as a mixed-integer linear problem (MILP). Simulation results confirm the important savings in non-renewable power consumption and enhanced throughput that can be reached using the proposed collaborative scheme, despite the exchange power losses. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

For this reason, it is necessary to construct an energy system based on renewable energy. This research proposes a power generation system that utilizes unique state change characteristics by thermal cycle of carbon dioxide hydrate. The energy necessary for operating the proposed system is only heat, outside air temperature (low temperature heat source) is used in cold areas in winter, low temperature heat emission (high temperature heat source) of buildings and factories is used. In the trial system, electricity is obtained from the pressure difference during the phase change of CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             gas hydrate by the scroll type expander.

Transient base protection scheme uses initial polarities of current transients to determine whether a fault is in the protected zone, while the conventional protection scheme confirms the existence of fault. The scope of testing is limited to testing the functionality and generic performance characteristics of hybrid protection scheme. The implementation consists of both hardware and software sections including power system modelling, sensor designing and programming of the conventional relay logic. The operation of the hybrid protection scheme is demonstrated using hardware-in-the-loop simulations. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In the bulk power system, forecasting and scheduling demand and generating resources is the initial step in maintaining power system frequency. To improve system frequency, controllable generating resources can provide adjustments to ensure balance between supply and demand in real-time operations. This existing process is currently being challenged with the deployment of intermittent sources such as wind and solar, which can impact total supply and demand forecasts. As a result, more flexible resources and more dynamic control schemes are clearly needed to adapt the system design to meet the disruptive renewable sources being deployed in large numbers. In this paper, the goal is to demonstrate how through minimizing schedule deviations by a unified smart generating system, the short-term primary frequency response, as well as the long-term frequency profile of a multi-area network can be significantly enhanced. This concept can potentially improve system operations through distributed control schemes rather than centralized control schemes currently adopted by independent system operators. To demonstrate this concept, realtime digital simulation with hardware-in-the-loop has been deployed to mimic realistic conditions under which schedule deviations and primary frequency response can be improved in real-time. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Because there is a big portion of non-electric energy forms are also employed in daily uses, such as logs, solar, and biogas water heaters, so still there is a deficiency associated with these grids. There is an attempt to trade these non-electrical energy forms in the next generation smart grids. However, the option discussed in that study is not well established, and it is built based on only transferring hot waters through pipelines connected between entities. Actually, this approach has some limitations and it could be a non-optimal choice to trade nonelectrical energy forms in terms of minimum losses, maximum profit, less risks, more flexibility, environment friendly, aesthetics, etc. This study discusses multiple possible options to locally trade these non-electric energy forms in the next generation smart grids. Therefore, the best option can be selected based on a tradeoff or a single/multi-objective approach. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The proposed TE framework is evaluated in terms of the annual distribution transformer loss of life reduction and the economic cost to the distribution system operator considering the effect of prosumers owning plug-in electric vehicles with consideration of both time-of-use (TOU) and distributed locational marginal pricing (DLMP) schemes. The results have shown that in case of DLMP pricing the distribution transformer's aging was almost doubled when compared to TOU pricing schemes. Moreover, the application of the proposed TE framework results in extending the lifetime of the distribution transformers under both pricing schemes. Further results have shown that the cost to the electric utility to perform control action is nearly double when using TOU pricing rates versus the rates based on the DLMP pricing. Finally, the annual active power losses in the system were reduced through the proposed TE control framework by up to 2% in the case of DLMP pricing. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Hence, the present paper addresses the problem of natural character recognition and tries to investigate the performance of the One Class-Principal Component Analysis Classifier (OC-PCA). The OC-PCA classifier has the main advantage to absorb the high dimension of the feature vector with few samples. For evaluating the performance of the proposed classifier, experimental results are conducted on challenging Char74k dataset highlighting its robustness against the state-of-art. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, strategic manipulation is applied to multiple attribute decision making (MADM), in which decision makers can manipulate ranking results through attribute weights. In view of uncertainty evaluations in decision making, the alternative evaluations are assumed to be represented in interval values, and a final decision result can be obtained by aggregating the interval evaluations of alternatives under different attribute weights. Firstly, a model is established to estimate the ranking of all alternatives, and a strategic manipulation model is further established to obtain the desired ranking by manipulating attribute weights. The proposed method can better conform to the actual situation by considering the uncertainty. Finally, the method is applied to the university ranking to obtain the desired ranking results and help decision makers choose the attribute weights according to their desired ranking of universities. Numerical simulation also verifies the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper builds a model of urban rail transit on economic growth based on the consideration of the impact of various factors on the economic growth, using data of prefecture-level panel cities in China during 2003-2013. The empirical results of this paper indicate that the elasticity of urban rail transit on urban economic growth is 0.025, indicating that it plays an important role in the economic growth of China's cities and China's urban rail transit is a major city economic. The promotion effect of growth is very significant but has no significant effect on the economic growth of small cities. Buses, taxis, and road infrastructure also have a significant influence on promoting urban economic growth, but they are all embodied in small cities. Therefore, cities need to choose suitable transportation modes according to their own economic development. Major cities should continue to develop rail transit, promote the PPP model in the development process, and increase the ratio of light rail to suburban railways. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper used remote sensing images from 2000, 2005, 2011, and 2016 as data sources. Based on the NDVI pixel dichotomy, the coverage was calculated and the coverage was graded. The transfer matrix method and the difference method were used. The spatial autocorrelation analysis method was used to study the temporal and spatial dynamic changes of vegetation coverage. The results showed that the average coverage of the four phases of the study area was above 0.69, which were 0.78, 0.71, 0.69, and 0.69 respectively. The coverage of vegetation was better, but the overall coverage was declining and tended to be stable. Obviously, the phenomenon of aggregate distribution in the spatial distribution shows the rules of \"high-high aggregation\" and \"low-low aggregation\". \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "                             Drought is the main agrometeorological disaster in Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which has great influences on the growth of the crops and directly affects grain yield. Technologies of agricultural production level is low sciences of investment is little, and irrigation installation is poor in DPRK. Therefore, it is easy to cause a reduction in grain yield if drought occurs in DPRK. The Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture (GIEWS) had proposed to warning food security of DPRK in 2017. Meanwhile, the food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations had also claimed that the rainfall in summer was insufficient and the grain yield would be reduction in DPRK. Hence, assessing the drought condition in DPRK is very important to understand the effects of drought on grain yield in 2017. In this study, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)3B43 time series dataset from 1998 to 2017 was used to monitor the temporal and spatial characteristics of drought in DPRK in 2017. At national scale, the results show that the annual precipitation in 2017 was clearly lower than average precipitation during 1998 and 2017 in DPRK. Particularly, the annual precipitation was the lowest since 1998 in southern DPRK. A large number of studies show that Z-index can accurately assess the grade of drought. In this study, Z-index was applied for assessment the drought condition basis on TRMM data in 2017, which is used by the National Meteorological Center of China. The main agricultural regions were strongly affected by the drought in the study area, such as, in Hwanghaenam-do, Hwanghaebuk-do and Pyonganbuk-do. Furthermore, we assessed drought condition of crop growing season during March and September in 2017. According to Z-index, there was obvious drought in March, June and September in DPRK. The drought was severity in western DPRK in March. The magnitude of drought in Pyonganbuk-do was extreme drought and the Z-index value was -2.41 that was the lowest in 2017. Meanwhile, the magnitude of drought was severe drought in parts of Chagang-do and Pyongannam-do indicating obviously affected by drought. Moreover, 1.14 \u00d7 10                             <sup>5</sup>                              km                             <sup>2</sup>                              (93.5%) area was affected by drought in June including Pyonganbuk-do, Pyongannam-do, Pyongyang City, Hwanghaebuk-do, Hwanghaenam-do and Hamgyungnam-do where showed magnitude of the drought is extreme drought. The maximum Z-index value was -1.95, that appeared in the Hwanghaenam-do. In addition, 75.3% of the study area appeared drought in September, especially eastern and central DPRK. The magnitude of drought was extreme drought in Gangwon-do. Totally, there were more than 2.0\u00d710                             <sup>4</sup>                              km                             <sup>2</sup>                              of croplands affected by drought in DPRK in 2017. The grain yield would be reduced due to drought occur during growing season in 2017. Thus, it is expected that the food gap would be appearance in 2018. Food aid should be provided by the international community in future.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Different from a traditional operational management, consumers in our model have their own willingness to wait or leave when procuring service. We derive the risking pricing strategies under the interactions between service quality and consumers' intensity. Making the quality and service speed trade-off, the optimal pricing strategies and optimal service rate are obtained for the monopoly provider and the social planner respectively. We also find how the service provider's risk coefficient affect its optimal strategies as well as the consumers' equilibrium strategies through numerical examples. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

MSLA SDMs offer superior performance than conventional single-bit SDMs for a multitude of applications relying on single-bit signal representation. However, traditional look-ahead SDMs have very high algorithmic complexity. MSLA SDMs overcome this problem by transforming the minimization problem associated with traditional look-ahead SDMs. A proof-of-concept IC implementation of a specific MSLA SDM is discussed and compared to a conventional single-bit SDM in terms of performance and hardware complexity. It is demonstrated that MSLA SDMs are a viable alternative to conventional single-bit SDMs when better performance with moderate additional hardware complexity are required. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Nowadays, the deployment of smart home doesn't require purchasing expensive devices due to advances in communication and computing technologies. However, implementing a customized home emergencies management system is not an easy task. Indeed, it involves two disciplines: (i) Medicine and (ii) Information and Communication Technologies as mentioned by the World Health Organization.In this paper, we propose an approach that hybridizes the two concepts: FSM theory and set theory. The aim is being to facilitate (i) the design of the system behavior for the health professionals, (ii) the translation of the human readable format (emergency management rules) to a machine readable format for the computer specialist, and (iii) mainly the verification of the FSM properties for reducing human errors for both of them. The paper gives the formal description of the set-based FSM, properties that have to be taken into account and the representation of process algebra expressions. Finally, we describe a case study to illustrate the benefits of the proposed FSM. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

We show that efficient piezoelectric transduction of a high frequency (~744 MHz) lateral-extensional mode of vibration and a quality factor as high as ~1300 can be achieved when a 70 nm thick platinum layer is employed as the interdigitated electrode underneath of a 200 nm thick AlN nano plate. Such a high value of quality factor is comparable to that achieved in reference devices with inversed electrode design (employing an unpatterned floating plate as the bottom electrode). The smoothly-transitioned topography of the bottom electrode, more specifically, the tapered edge of the patterned interdigitated electrode is identified as the key contributing factor to the achievement of high quality factors. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Therefore, researchers never stopped digging deeper to improve them. In this context, data mining techniques have been highly exploited for intrusion detection. In this paper, we present a comparative study of data mining techniques for intrusion detection. Specifically, we study the overall performances of those methods as well as the impact of training data size on their results. We use ISCX2012 as a benchmark for our experimentation. A realistic dataset that represents at a certain level today's network traffic. The study shows that relatively old methods outperform some of the techniques highly used actually by the community. Regarding the impact of training dataset size, the investigated methods react differently from each other when we add more data to the training dataset. In addition, the results highlight the importance of attack traffic in the training dataset. Moreover, they strongly suggest the use of Random Forest for intrusion detection due to its linear performance relation with the training dataset's size. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The standard OEO takes advantage of the amplitude modulation of an optical carrier using Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZM) using LiNbO                             <sub>3</sub>                              (LN) substrates. A Sagnac loop topology is proposed to convert phase modulation to intensity modulation (PM-IM) in the forced OEO. The phase sensitivity of the phase modulator and its losses is a critical component in overall performance of the OEO, and particularly for the forced oscillation OEOs using self-injection locking (SIL) and self-phase locking (SPLL). Integrated Si-Photonics phase modulators (PM) using electro-optic (EO) polymers and Si-Ge Bi-CMOS RF driver has added benefits of smaller size and lower cost systems. A higher modulation efficiency and bandwidth of the EO polymer based PM is demonstrated by slow wave structures of photonic bandgap (PBG) with a \\mathbf{V}-{\\pi} of 1.38V and insertion loss (IL) of 1.6dB compared to LN based systems of 3V with IL of 4dB. The predicted phase noise performance for the PBG based PM is estimated to be -160dBc/Hz at 10kHz offset over X-band.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, we focus on the problem of sea ice change detection from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Existing works usually treat the problem as a classification task. Recently, researchers noticed that humans and animals learn much better when the examples are organized in a meaningful order, and proposed Self-Paced Boost Learning (SPBL) to simulate the process. Inspired by this, we proposed a novel sea ice change detection method based on SPBL. First, log-ratio operator is utilized for difference image generation. Then, a hierarchical fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is employed to select reliable samples. Finally, based upon these samples, SPBL is employed to classify pixels from the original SAR images into unchanged and changed class. The quantitative and qualitative analysis on two real SAR datasets has demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Indeed, the developed approach aims to ensure the minimization of the torque and to improve the motor performance.

So it is vital significant to accurately and quickly extract coastline and real-time monitor the changes. Many approaches have been developed to automatically extract coastline. After comprehensive comparison, it was found that combining mean-shift with region growing algorithm could extract the coastline very well. In this paper, the MNDWI was firstly used to roughly determine the range of shoreline. Then, mean-shift was applied to remove the noise, and finally the continuous coastline was extracted using the method of regional growth. Experiments show that the method could extract the continuous coastline accurately and quickly. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

According to the subsidence range and damage degree during the 2007-2017 years in the study area, the depth of crack and the area of crack area in the mining subsidence area are determined, and the disturbance effect of soil moisture change caused by mining subsidence is discussed. The analysis shows that due to the loose surface layer caused by surface cracks, the absorption and evaporation effect of surface water is aggravated, and the soil moisture in the subsidence area is higher than that in the non-subsidence area in the low temperature season of January. In the high temperature season of July, the evaporation degree of the subsidence area is higher than that in the non-subsidence area, and the relative soil moisture is lower than that in the non-subsidence area. This fully reflects the change of surface soil environment caused by coal mining subsidence. The above research results have guiding significance for land evaluation and environmental improvement in coal mining subsidence area in Western China. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Furthermore, we also examined the moderating role of power distance between leadership-member exchange and workplace friendship. Questionnaire survey data were collected from 214 railway workers in China. In general, the results show that: (1) the leadership-member exchange has a significant positive impact on the knowledge sharing; (2) workplace friendship plays a partial mediating role between leadership-member exchange and knowledge sharing; (3) power distance plays moderating role between leadership-member exchange and workplace friendship. The higher the power distance perceived by employees, the weaker the positive relationship between the leadership-member exchange and the workplace friendship. Finally, theoretical and practical implications were put forwarded stemming from this study and the suggest directions for future researches were also provided. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Due to the time and cost problems with traditional drug discovery, new methods must be found to increase the declining efficiency of traditional approaches. Virtual Screening (VS) is one possible solution to solve this problem. VS of databases has become an attractive method for pharmaceutical research. It plays a crucial role in the early stage of the drug discovery and development process. It aims to reduce the enormous search space of chemical compounds. As the number of ligands in the databases is increasing rapidly, this step should be both fast and effective in order to distinguish between active and inactive ligands. Deep learning algorithms can be used for screening big databases of molecules and classifying the ligands as drug-like and non-druglike against a particular protein target and therefore speed up the VS process. In this paper, we propose a fast compound classification method based on a deep neural network for Virtual Screening called (DNN-VS) using the Spark-H2O platform in order to label small molecules from huge databases. Experimental results have shown that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning techniques with an overall accuracy more than 99%. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Taking the Qinling Mountains in Shaanxi Province as the research area, based on the MODIS NDVI data after time series reconstruction, combined with the land-use status data, DEM data, and forest resources survey results, the change-vector analysis method and overlay segmentation method were used to analyze the degree of change in land cover and the type of change were explored in the Qinling Mountains from 2000 to 2015. The results showed that: 1)The most significant change of the land use map unit in the Qinling Mountains in 2000-2015 was the \"deciduous forest to mingled forest\", \"cultivated land to deciduous forest\" is the second largest unit type, accounting for 46.32% and 12.74% of the changeable area respectively. The other land use types have the smallest change to the water body, accounting for less than 0.01% of the area. 2) According to the NDVI cumulative change rate and the segmentation threshold, the NDVI change vector intensity types are determined: increasing, fluctuating, decreasing and stable. The area of increasing type accounted for 35.53%, and distributed around Shangluo in the northeast of the study area, Ankang in the southwest of Hanzhong and the south of the city mainly. The fluctuating type and decreasing area accounted for 5.46% and 0.85%, respectively. The fluctuating type was mixed among other types of changes, and the decreasing type were mainly distributed along the gentle slopes along the Luo River, Han River and Danjiang River, and around the city. The stable type has a dominant position and is distributed over a large area outside the areas of increasing, decreasing, and fluctuating, with an area ratio of 58.16%. In the areas with an altitude elevation of less than 1000m in the Qinling Mountains, the NDVI change vector increase dominates. With the increase of altitude, the NDVI change vector type within the range of 1500-2700m altitude is dominated by the stable type, and the proportion of the increasing type is reduced by the altitude; In the areas with a high altitude of 2700m, the NDVI change slowly increases year by year, showing an increase in the proportion of increased pixel area. Based on the dynamic analysis of vegetation cover change intensity in mountainous regions of Qinling Mountains, this paper reveals the intensity and regularity of vegetation changes in mountainous regions, provideing a basis for rapid monitoring of large-scale land cover changes, and has practical significance for the ecological protection of the Qinling Mountains. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The findings of the study show that there exists a long-run co-integration relationship among GDP, education attainment at all levels, average schooling years, education Gini coefficient and total wages of employees. Average schooling years have negative effect on economic growth, whilst other variables have positive effect on economic growth. The study concludes that human capital of casino industry acts as a key determinant of economic growth in Macau. In recent years, violent competitions have emerged from Asian countries, and they have continuously provided new electronic gaming products. It is acceptable that employees with higher education attainment have abilities to learn new skills and knowledge and then create new products. We would suggest that the government has to pay more attention to investment in human capital to maintain sustainable economic growth. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Accident data of 6 years are saved, however some records are not completed or description is not clear generating incompleteness and uncertainty. A conceptual and generic model should be developed with a protocol for assessing the risk of injuries on persons and a computational module which constitute a decisional support system for risk assessment (DSRS). Then, experiment the model and generate many scenarios to understand and create knowledge about causes or conditions that generate those dreaded events.

Owing to complex coastline environment, the existing sea-land segmentation algorithms are difficult to extract helpful features while dealing with large-scale satellite remote sensing images. The paper presents a coarse-to-fine sea-land segmentation approach by combining the improved structured edge network (SeNet) and the coastline database. First of all the coarse latitude and longitude of the segmentation points between sea and land is obtained through applying coastline database to remote sensing images. Secondly on the basis of segmentation point, the region around coastline is divided into a group of blocks with 800\u00d7800 pixels. Finally SeNet is improved to separate the sea and land of the region. Experiential results on a large data set demonstrated that the proposed method achieved better accuracy and running time than the other methods. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The traditional methods of sampling plays an important role in the wetland ecosystem health assessment, but there also exists some problems such as a waste of human and financial resources and the limition of the number of sampling points. Remote sensing technology can obtain surface data for long time series, which has important advantages in wetland structural change and ecological health assessment. In this paper, the characteristics of wetland structure of Wuliangsuhai in the past 40 years from 1977 to 2015 were studied by using multi-temporal LandSAT data. The driving factors of wetland structure change were analyzed. The ecological health of Wuliangsuhai wetland was evaluated based on the pressure-state-response (PSR) model. The results showed that: (1) In 1997, the wetland structure was dominated by the water, and the water area was 61.70% of the whole wetland area. With the decrease of the water area and the increase of the reed area, the reed and water became the main types of wetland structure during the period from 1998 to 2006. The total area of wetland was 50% higher than that of wetland in 2015, and the structure of wetland was changed from water to reed in 1977. (2) The ecological health status of Wuliangsuhai wetland was in an alert state from 1977 to 1996. The ecological function level of the Wuliangsuhai wetland was degraded, but the ecological system could be maintained. The ecological health status of the Wuliangsuhai Wetland in 2006 and 2015 changed from the original alert state to a good state, but the comprehensive evaluation index was in the lower limit of the good condition, which indicated that the ecological health status of the Wuliangsuhai wetland had improved, the external pressure was decreased but not obvious. The results provide scientific basis for the management of Wuliangsuhai wetland, and have important reference value for monitoring the structure and health status of wetland via remote sensing data. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The solution allows sub-microsecond level timestamping of logic control events and analogue to digital (ADC) measurements. The system is based on low cost, miniature commercially off the shelf (COTS) hardware. External time referencing can be supplied via network timing protocol (NTP), precision timing protocol (PTP) and/or a discrete pulse per second (PPS) signal. The operating distance is extendable to tens of kilometers using a simplified PPS transmission system over fibre, based on the Karoo array timing system (KATS) developed at South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO). Integration into the MeerKAT Radio Telescope's time and frequency modules shows CISPR 22 compliance and cross coupling effects for sensitive phase transfer systems are below the stringent EMC limits acceptable for radio astronomy. Real-time control is of great importance for industrial and scientific applications. After evaluating existing market-based solutions., these were found to be either cost prohibitive, non-EMC compliant or requiring proprietary network protocols. This implementation serves to offer a time synchronisation solution which is low in cost., has a small footprint and easily integrated into timing applications. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Based on the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology) model and Cobb-Douglas production function, this paper uses the Generalized Method of Moments model to conduct a regression analysis of China's haze pollution. The results show that FDI (foreign direct investment) will have a \u00bbpollution halo\u00bb effect. Moreover, the introduction of more excellent FDI and increased investment in science and technology can improve the status of haze pollution in China. The population has a significant negative effect on PM2.5 concentrations. Therefore, based on the above analysis and conclusions, this paper proposes corresponding suggestions to contribute to the improvement of the status of haze pollution in China. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Planetary remote sensing images are mainly acquired by linear cameras. Existing geometric rectification software tools in planetary mapping community show unsatisfactory computational performance. In this paper, an efficient geometric rectification method for planetary linear pushbroom images is developed based on a fast back projection (or ground-to-image) algorithm. Additionally, a generic rigorous sensor model is introduced to support different planetary linear pushbroom images. The proposed method was tested using images acquired by Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow Angle Cameras and Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera. The geometric accuracy was verified using the orthophotos generated by Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS). The root mean square errors of conjugate points on the generated orthophotos were less than 0.3 pixels. In case of single-threaded programming, the proposed geometric rectification method was about 4 times faster than ISIS. Whereas multi-threaded programming with four worker threads was more than 3 times faster than single-threaded programming. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly improved the computational performance of geometric rectification for planetary images. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Through setting the first-and second-order derivatives of the frequency respect to temperature to zeroes, a family of quartz crystal cuts with different temperatures of zero frequency (turnover temperatures) has been found and examined. It is now possible to fabricate quartz crystal resonators with turnover temperature near its operating temperature to keep the resonator functioning in a lean and more natural state. By selecting a few cuts based on orientations from our study, we analyzed the thickness-shear vibrations of quartz crystal plates to confirm the superior frequency-temperature relations with the theory of incremental thermal field and Mindlin plate equations and presenting comparisons with known AT-and SC-cut to demonstrate that resonators with newly found cuts can also achieve exceptional frequency stability as demanded. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

We present a methodology to build a regionally specific spectral library of karst materials including: vegetation, carbonate rock, soil, and water. Using this library, we applied MESMA to generate a total of 1000 two-, three-, and four-endmember models for each Landsat 8 OLI pixel, and the mapped fractions were validated using WorldView-2 plots. The results showed that a majority of the image could be modeled successfully with two- or three-endmember SMA models. The validation results indicated the robustness of MESMA for deriving spatially continuous variables quantified at the sub-pixel level. Quantitative analysis of the resulting percent KRD and comparative analyses with traditional Liner Spectral Unmixing (LSU) indicate that MESMA improved the estimation accuracy of KRD. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This material combination was selected, because quartz has a higher velocity of leaky SAW than LT and a positive temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF). An impedance ratio of 82 dB and a Bode Q of 3, 000 were obtained, and TCFs at series and parallel resonance were measured to be +2 and -10 ppm/PC, respectively. Compared with the characteristics of a standard 42\u00b0YX LT SAW resonator fabricated in the same facility, the impedance ratio is higher by 31 dB, the bode Q is 6.3 times higher, and the TCFs at series and parallel resonance are as small as 1/25 and 1/6, respectively. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

As an important vertical classification in the O2O field, catering enterprises usually cooperate with online and offline catering businesses to improve data operation capability by forecasting the trend of orders. On the basis of analyzing the O2O enterprise's existing business model and management of data, this paper establishes an ARIMA time series, a BP neural network model and a combined model to predict the order of the enterprise based on a takeaway operation data of a catering enterprise, and implements and verifies the model. Through the comparative analysis of the prediction results of the model, this paper can help enterprises carry out in-depth data operation in the catering O2O mode, and assist enterprises at all levels to make reasonable resource allocation. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper evaluates the effect of HSRs on the economic growth in China using the data from 2007 to 2016 and uses the Gradient Boosting Regression Tree to carry out an empirical test. The paper argues that when analyzing the economic impact of new transportation means, both the construction of itself and improvement of transportation conditions should be taken into account. Therefore, the HSR was studied by operation mileages and its proportion to total railway mileage. The main conclusion from the paper is that Chinese HSR has a positive effect on economic growth. The difference of the purpose and background of HSR construction between China and other countries may be the reasons for the inconsistency of the research conclusions. Thus, Chinese government needs to optimize the HSR networks and improve transport services. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The SAR images are acquired in November 2016 and March 2017 from Ningbo and Nanjing area, particularly, the images in Nanjing area are the first meter degree interferometric pair. With the spatial baseline about 600 m and time baseline 116 days, the coherence of the most urban areas still achieves good enough to generate the digital elevation model (DEM), whereas for the mountain areas, the decoherence phenomenon is serious. During the InSAR processing, we compared several baseline estimating methods and obtained a good flat-earth phase removed interferogram map. By using the latest SAR interferogram filter and phase unwrapping method we proposed, we improved the coherence up to 0.8 in urban area. To reduce the spread unwrapped phase errors coursed by low coherence area, we partitioned the unwrapped phase map and calibrated the baseline and phase offset parameters based on the partitioned image. Then the DEM of high coherence areas were retrieved in each block, and for low coherence areas, the existing DEM auxiliary method was used. In addition, after the orthorectification, we evaluated the elevation model by comparing with the elevation values extracted from SRTM and field measured GPS elevation. And the result shows that accuracy of the elevation map is about 10 m (RMSE) in most of the studied region. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of the Shape Exchange Algorithm (SEA) for the purpose of general Time Series Classification (TSC). Indeed, the SEA method is very effective in quasi-periodic time series matching. However, for general time series, it has been found that this method needs some kind of enhancement to meet state-of-the-art TSC techniques. The proposed LMDS-SEA method (Local Matching with Distance Selection Shape Exchange Algorithm) is based on two ideas: a) Distance Selection as an adaptation paradigm for classification method and b) Local Matching. The distance selection contribution consists in dynamically selecting the best distance to apply as a function of the data to classify from a pool of Euclidian Distance (ED), SEA and LM-SEA (Local Matching SEA). The Local Matching (SEA) contribution consists in matching equal and corresponding sub-sequences in the two time series to match, X and Y, using the SEA method locally. The newly proposed LMDS-SEA method was applied to classification of the public UCR benchmark (UCR: General Time Series Classification/Clustering dataset of the University of California at Riverside) based on 1NN classifier. Results show significant enhancements in the classification accuracy of the proposed 1NN LMDS-SEA classifier over the 1NN SEA classifier (1NN LMDS-SEA: 64 WINs, 1NN SEA: 00 WINs and 21 Ties). Results show also that the proposed 1NN LMDS-SEA classifier is more effective than the very effective 1NN DTW classifier (1NN LMDS-SEA: 50 WINs, 1NN DTW: 28 WINs and 7 Ties). Note that a win is credited to a classifier A over a classifier B if A is more accurate than classifier B, class-wise, over the 85 classes of the UCR benchmark. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Here, after reviewing the theory of the J2 relativistic effect, we carefully analyze GPS clocks' data looking for the J2 periodic component. Moreover, we study its effect on the clock's Allan deviation, showing how it deforms the shape of the bump visible at an averaging time of about one half of the satellites' orbital period, due to periodic frequency variations of other origin. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The results show that the growth of total factor productivity of traditional manufacturing industry of Beijing mainly relied on technological progress, and that technological efficiency declined during the sample period. Pure technological efficiency was less than 1 throughout the sample period, while scale efficiency gradually increased. The overall input-output level deviated from the optimal production status.

The non-formed spatial structure of urban systems restricts regional development. Using spatial data of urban land monitored via remote sensing and spatial transportation data as real connection distance, a commonly used gravity-based urban interactive model is modified to analyze the spatial structures of two important urban clusters in this area. The results show that urban cluster in Guanzhong is strongly centralized and require a rank-balanced spatial structure. Developing the cities of Baoji and Tongchuan can improve the spatial structure of urban cluster in Guanzhong, and that of medium-small cities of Yangling and Chengcheng. Urban cluster on the north slope of the Tianshan Mountains is scattered and need overall developing.

        "abstract": "Combing forest inventory sample plot data and remotely sensed images has been rarely applied to single tree volume inversion by spatial interpolation methods such as regression and spatial simulation, With the increase of the resolution of remote sensing image, the inversion of single tree volume is possible. However, various uncertainty factors seriously affect the inversion accuracy, and the position error is the most deadly uncertainty factor in the single-tree volume inversion. In this study, 909 Cunninghamia lanceolata measured in 15 sample plots of middle-aged planted in the experimental area of Huangfengqiao Forest Farm in Hunan Province were selected as the research object. Multivariate Stepwise Regression, Partial Least-Squares Regression and BP Neural Network were used to establish the estimation model of Cunninghamia lanceolata volume based on GF-2 images. The position error is simulated through the location of moving tree. Using a random array, each tree can be randomly divided into 8 directions (east, west, south, north, northeast, northwest, southwest, and southeast), and the moving distance is 1m, 2m, until 10m in sequence. The inversion and accuracy evaluation of Cunninghamia lanceolata volume with three established models for each movement. The results show that the inversion accuracy decreases slowly with the offset distance within 2m. When the offset exceeds the 2m, the inversion accuracy drops sharply, and then subtle fluctuations occur, maintaining a steady state with low accuracy. The three models showed the same trend. More importantly, it was found that there is a spatial autocorrelation between the blades, which can effectively alleviate the effect of the position error on the inversion accuracy in the crown. But when the position error exceeds the crown, the inversion of single tree volume is completely meaningless. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

To compare the compression rate, loading time, loading speed, loading speed, portability and convenience under the given experimental data, according to the four commonly used storage modes (scattered files, ZIP files, SQLite database files and tile flow collection files). The experimental results show that loading SQLite database files loading tiles, the average time consuming 301ms, the average memory consumption 25.8MB, the overall performance is the best, is the preferred format for the Android version of the GIS grid data storage. At the same time, the test results show that the comprehensive advantage of the custom tile flow collection file is significant. If the storage structure of the file is further optimized, it can completely replace the SQLite storage mode and no longer be limited to the limitation of the database itself. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

According to 31 provincial data in 2003, 2010 and 2017, we conduct an empirical study concerning the spatial spillover effects of transport infrastructure on regional economic growth. The result shows that the capital and labor still make the largest contributions to the regional economic growth. The human capital, government expenditure, trade openness and the transport infrastructure play a more and more important positive role in promoting the economic development. Moreover, the direct effects of transport infrastructure on regional economic growth still account for the vast majority of the whole effects. A positive spatial spillover effect significantly exists and without considering the spatial spillover effects will overestimate the direct effects of transport infrastructure on economic growth. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

More specifically, we are addressing the trajectory planning and motion planning of the end-effector using the PSO algorithm. Hence, a multi-objective PSO has been investigated to plan the optimal trajectory of the end-effector by avoiding the obstacles, as well as we have introduced the virtual shortest path concept. On the other hand, we have proposed a combination of the modified PSO and the Tabu search algorithm to select the optimal configuration of the manipulator joints. Moreover, the energy consumed by the robot has been taken into consideration.In order to assess the effectiveness of our proposal, it has been evaluated under different simulation scenarios, where the results figured out that our proposal is promising and can be applied to both robot manipulators and mobile robots. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Scalloped patterns are fabricated by a sequence of isotropic and anisotropic deep reactive ion etching (DRIE). Here, the fabrication parameters are adjusted to obtain micro-size scalloped patterns. Sufficient amount of atomic Cs has been successfully observed in the microfabricated cells by a hotplate heating at about 315\u00b0C. This fabrication method enables effective thermal decomposition of Csn3 on Si substrate by low-temperature process, leading to reduce complexity of microfabricated vapor cells fabrication. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Therefore, combining with the practical experience of constructing about 4000 square kilometers of high-precision 3D models in Beijing, this paper puts forward a set of solutions to the key technologies used in the construction of high-precision 3D models based on oblique photograph in oversize cities, including: photo control point layout scheme, the technical route of building monomeric model and building 3d model by the integration of aerial photos and the near-ground photos.

The resonators are made of CMOS interconnect metal (Aluminum and Tungsten) and insulation layers (silicon dioxide) and utilize two sets of electrically isolated metal double layers for thermal actuation and piezoresistive readout. The oxide layers within the resonator structures lead to an improved temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) of -2.7 ppm/\u00b0C, (~10X better than silicon). The fabricated resonators were embedded in a custom-made miniature aerosol impactor collecting and measuring the mass concentration of airborne particulates. Tests performed on air samples from different sources with different particle mass concentrations ranging from 0.014-0.085 \u03bcg/m3 show a clear correlation between the mass balance frequency shifts and the expected particle concentrations. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The steep natural terrain in Hong Kong is susceptible to shallow, small to medium-sized landslides induced by rainfall. These landslides usually involve failures occurring within the top one to two meters of the surface mantle. Terrain features manifested on the ground surface, such as historical landslides, rock outcrops, tension cracks, depressions could affect the terrain's susceptibility to landsliding in future. Identification of these features by conventional means involves substantial resources for Aerial Photo Interpretation (API) and field mapping. A pilot study was carried out to explore the potential of using deep learning to enhance the efficiency in identifying rock outcrops at a territory-wide scale with a view to improving the landslide susceptibility analysis. A methodology of combining Convolutional Neural Network and remote sensing techniques has been developed to derive a very high-resolution map of rock outcrops exposed on the natural terrain throughout the entire Hong Kong territory. The developed algorithm considers the spatial relationship and texture of the surrounding pixels as well as the spectral signature of the pixel of remote sensing imageries. The identification of rock outcrops has been conducted using the orthophotos acquired in years 2012 and 2015, with the aid of SPOT satellite images acquired in year 2015 and airborne LiDAR data acquired in year 2010, and resulting in a five-meter spatial resolution rock outcrops map. The results were promising when validated with the results mapped by engineering geologists using API on the same sets of orthophotos. The developed algorithm provides an alternative for leveraging the balance between spectral and spatial resolution, and for mapping the natural surface features and enhancing the landslide susceptibility analysis. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The b-chromatic number of a graph G is the largest integer k such that the graph has a b-coloring with k colors. The graph b-coloring is a NP-hard problem and there is no heuristic used to solve it in literature. In this paper, a hybrid approach based on genetic algorithm, recursive largest first heuristic (RLF), and specific heuristic for mutation, is proposed, to solve the b-coloring problem. The problem is formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem in which two objectives are considered. To validate our work, the proposed algorithm was tested and compared with relative proven and known theorical results for specific graphs, such as regular graphs and trees. In addition the algorithm was tested for some general graphs, and the obtained results are encouraging. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Extraction of tree crown has always been a research hotspot in forestry remote sensing. With the rapid development of UAV technology, aerial imagery can clearly identify the information of ground forest tree crowns. However, Due to the overlapping of tree crown, how to divide the crown size between trees is still a difficult problem. In this paper, the ecological experiment forest of Central South University of Forestry and Technology was selected as the study area, the UAV image in the visible light band was used as experimental data, and the Pinus massoniana as the object of study, the transect sample algorithm was used to extract the size of the individual forest tree crown in the study area. By analyzing the correlations between R, G, and B bands in the visible light band, several major visible vegetation indices and tree crown information, relevant factors suitable for tree crown extraction were selected. Since the aerial imagery used in this study has an ultra-high resolution, the gaps in the crown width of single wood are clearly visible, which is not conducive to transect sample algorithm to extract the crown width. Therefore, the image is smoothed by setting the window size of the 7\u22177 pixel to reduce the influence of the crown gap on the transect sample algorithm. In the end, the tree crown was extracted by the transect sample algorithm. The results show that: The green band and the CIVE extraction. The total precision of the extraction of Pinus massoniana by transect sample algorithm is 84.1%, and the method can extract the single crown of partial crown to a certain extent, and it can get better effect for the forest with low canopy density. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It is opined that: 1. The trend of NDVI/EVI changes from 2013 to 2014 in Xi'an Region has a significant drop, with the rate of decline being 2.83%/a and 3.75%/a, respectively, and then rising. The growth rate of NDVI/EVI in 2014-2016 They were 3.25%/a and 3.95%/a, respectively. 2. The average monthly NDVI/EVI trend during the year in Xi'an shows a bimodal pattern, and the trend of the different phases of the monthly phase curve is similar. It can be seen that the overall NDVI/EVI changes in Xi'an during the 7 years show obvious phenological cycle changes. 3. For the same ground cover, the sensitivity of NDVI / EVI is not the same. By fitting the NDVI / EVI of the 7-month time series image of 7 years, the equation is obtained: y = 0.0556e3.0404x, R2 = 0.9511, indicating when When NDVI > 0.6, EVI is more sensitive to vegetation changes than NDVI. 5. According to the bipartite principle, the vegetation coverage of Xi'an was calculated. The results showed that the vegetation coverage in Xi'an Region has a strong regularity in spatial distribution. The high vegetation coverage area is mainly concentrated in the Qinling area south of Xi'an, and the low vegetation coverage area. Focusing on the downtown area centered on the clock tower, the contrast between the EVI and NDVI images shows that NDVI is easily saturated in high vegetation areas, and the spectral resolution of vegetation in high vegetation areas is less than that of EVI. 5. Selecting five regions of interest for block analysis, the vegetation coverage in the inner city, the second ring, and the surrounding city shows an increasing trend, and with the narrowing of the range, the growing trend becomes more obvious. The results indicate that, in the Xi'an Region, the overall changes in both NDVI and EVI are insignificant. The big reason is the effect of regional compensation, the construction of the city is saturated, the green vegetation is no longer destroyed, and along with vegetation growth and the city Greening, vegetation coverage develops in a good direction. Because the area around the county seat of HuXian County is still in the urbanization stage, the vegetation coverage in the area has been declining over time. Since there are many ecological parks located in the ecological area, the vegetation coverage in the area has fluctuating trends. The overall remains unchanged. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This requires optimizing urban space structure, improving the urban environment thus it will lighten the general pressure on the Beijing. New urbanization plays a significant role for Hebei province in promoting economic growth and narrowing the gap with Beijing and Tianjin. Under the current constraints of ecological environment and resource, what actions should Hebei Province take to improve the quality of new urbanization is a question worth discussing in depth.

The hybrid sensor we study here utilizes the ultrasensitive magnetic field response of the nitrogen vacancy center (NV-center) in diamond in conjunction with the magnetostrictive property of Terfenol-D. We propose and simulate a device model for the experimental verification of local nanoscale stress sensing. We generate spatially varying stress in Terfenol-D with the help of the high-overtone bulk acoustic resonator (HBAR) which is then converted to the magnetic field via the Villari effect. We calculate the stress tensor of Terfenol-D, which is then fed into micromagnetic simulator to obtain magnetic field experienced by the NV ceters. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The 10MHz clock signal and synchronized timing encode signal are transferred to the multiple remote stations using general low cost optical transceiver module, and the transferred clock signal is used to eliminate the time error because of frequency deviation between local station and remote stations. The method of precise phase-shifting is used to real-time compensate the variation of the optical fiber transmission delay at the remote station. The testbed with the developed OFTWTF equipment is built in the laboratory to evaluate the performance of the OFTWTF equipment. Measurement results show that the relative stabilities are less than 40ps/1s and 8ps/1000s for 20 km fiber link. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper empirically studies the influence of equity structure and industry protection on the value of the company through a regression analysis method with the data of listed companies in China's A-share market from 2014 to 2017. At the same time, we study the relationship between the interaction effect of equity structure, industry protection and the value of listed companies. The results indicate the more concentrated the ownership structure, the more difficult it is to reach the value of the enterprise in the capital market of China. At present, the existence of industry protection fails to promote the value of the enterprise. On the contrary, the value of the listed company in the unprotected industry is easier to increase. Compared with the listed companies which are protected, the unprotected companies shows more significant negative correlation between ownership structure and corporate value, as the ownership structure tends to be concentrated. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Compared to traditional PMUTs, given that this one is on top of a CMOS pre-processed wafer, it will provide benefits in terms of fabrication without the complexity to use wafer bonding. These benefits will be clearly reflected i.e. in arrays, since the smaller pitch achievable between PMUTs, with no added bond-pads needed, will enable a higher fill factor with the advantages of reduced cost, area and power consumption. Pulse echo measurements of acoustic pressure in liquid provide competitive values compared with the state-of-the-art AlN PMUTs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

White Blood Cells segmentation is one of the most challenging topics in cytological image processing. In this work, we have proposed a semi-automatic process for White Blood Cells segmentation. The segmentation process is based on super-pixel classification using the semi-supervised co-Forest classifier. The first step of our process is about super-pixels generation by SLIC algorithm. In the second step, we apply the features extraction for each super-pixels, the features are extracted from color information (RGB) and Color Mean (CM). In the last step, we realize a semi-supervised classification to classify each super-pixel into nucleus and cytoplasm region. The super-pixel classification results gives a good segmentation of nucleus and cytoplasm of different nature and structure. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, the Sea has shrunk substantially over time and water quality has deteriorated considerably, mainly caused by agricultural and industrial pollutants, reduced inflow, and enhanced evaporation. Six functionally different spectral water indexes were selected and evaluated to determine their efficiency in estimating water surfaces during excessive growth of algae and outbreaks of green tide when water quality degraded significantly. The evaluation indicated that among the selected water indexes, the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was most efficient in differentiating open water from surrounding non-water features, and the differentiation was least affected by water quality change. MNDWI was applied to each archived Landsat TM imagery of the Salton Sea area acquired between 1982 and 2012. The extracted water surfaces showed that the Sea experienced significant change over the 31-year period and entered an accelerated drying stage in 2005. The results also revealed the clear seasonal variations of water surface extent, which increases from September to January and decreases afterwards. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Equity incentive, evolving from the evolution of agency cost, property rights structure and corporate value theory, has become instrument in modern enterprise management. The current research of equity incentive is limited to motivating high-level professional managers, and there are very few corresponding studies on incentives for middle-level, low-level professional managers as well as grass roots. The equity incentive system under the \u00bbpersonal stock\u00bb mode is applicable to both high-level and low-level professional managers, even to core grass roots. Therefore, this paper analyzes the impact of equity incentive on performance and value of the corporation under the \u00bbpersonal shares\u00bb mode. The empirical results demonstrate that the \u00bbpersonal shares\u00bb equity incentive model can optimize the corporate structure, improve the labor efficiency of professional managers and grass roots, promote the company's capital accumulation, and attract and retain staffs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

We use the speech signal to perform the interaction with augmented reality environment. This latter is composed of virtual car's components inserted in the real scene. Thanks to Windows Voice Recognition, the voice commands are recognized and translated into textual commands and they are interpreted in internal order by the AR system. This allows the user to manipulate the different parts and view them by simply giving voice commands, such as the designation of objects by their name to make them appear or move them indicating the next position. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The results showed: During the process of desertification, the responses of different plants at different stages were different, the degree of damage and the ability of resistance also varied. For Stipa bungeana, the leaf water content, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b decreased during the process of desertification, relative plasma membrane permeability and MDA increased constantly, the proline fluctuated and raised, indicated that it was damaged seriously and had strict requirements for habitat; for Cleistogenes squarrosa, the physiological responses were similar to Stipa bungeana, also had weak stress resistance; for Lespedeza davurica, the leaf water content was stable originally, then reduced at IV stage, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b decreased, relative plasma membrane permeability and proline increased, MDA increased firstly and then decreased and further raised, but the variance range was lower, indicated that although the membrane system subjected to a certain degree of damage, it had self-adaptive response, the damage was to a lesser extent; for Artemisia ordosica, the leaf water content reduced at first, raised again from II stage, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b also decreased at first and then increased gradually, relative plasma membrane permeability and proline raised at first and then kept stable at III stage, MDA fluctuated slightly with little changing, which showed the trend that increased firstly and then decreased and further raised, restrained the membrane lipid peroxidation cooperatively, membrane damage was not obvious; for Cynanchum komarovii, the physiological responses were similar to Artemisia ordosica. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The induced voltages across the resonator plates due to applied external magnetic signals have been computed within a COMSOL 3D finite-element model. Optimal orientations of the internal magnetization and polarization of the external H fields relative to the quartz crystalline axes were determined. Self-consistent coupled strains induced in the magnetostrictive film from both the piezoelectric plate deformations and the external magnetic field were included. The theory of magnetostriction and the characterization of magnetostrictive curve of thin-film Ni (nickel) deposited on quartz resonator with the Ni film magnetized either prior or after deposition were discussed. The magnetostriction curve is an important determinant of the induced voltage across the quartz plate in external H fields. Both the responses of the AT-cut resonator without Ni coating and with Ni coating were simulated in this paper. The experimentally observed response of a 355-MHz AT-cut resonator to the electric component of external RF wave was reported. The electric response of magnetostrictive Ni coated AT-cut resonator dominated the magnetic response. The sensitivity of electric response was calculated to be 320 mV/Oe. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

On the other hand, the growing advances on this field has let the complexity level to increase extensively. The problem is that the typical Hardware Description Languages (HDL) like VHDL and Verilog are made for synthesis and simulation only. But, the simulation technique could be deficient in complex designs such as the cryptographic circuits. Formal verification has became an important technique towards establishing the correctness of hardware designs. This paper presents a formal verification approach for the cryprographic circuits. It consists on using the functional language Haskell to formally describe both the behavioral and the structural descriptions. In addition, it relies on the use of the hierarchy and modularity techniques in order to reduce the complexity of the designs; and hence simplify the verification task. To show the potential features of the proposed approach, it is applied to the Data Encryption Standard (DES) circuit and its formal specification is presented. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Studying the change of the self-liquidation ratio under PPP mode has important guiding significance for the rational planning of the construction and operation of urban rail transit. This paper first discusses how to design the mechanism under the PPP mode to motivate various participants of the urban rail transit project to actively invest in the construction and operation of urban rail transit projects. Based on the existing self-liquidation ratio mode, it analyzes the rationality and accuracy of its composition from the theoretical perspective, considers the competitive neutrality and transferable risk-taking costs from the application level, and establishes a new self-liquidation ratio mode, which initiates inspiring thinking about the research on self-liquidation ratio mode. The new self-liquidation ratio mode can more accurately reflect the actual government performance under the non-PPP mode and has a strong incentive for attracting social capital into urban rail transit projects. Secondly, by comparing the financial indicators of the MTR Corporation and the metropolitan operation companies in Mainland China, we analyzed the revenue and cost to explore whether the PPP model can effectively enhance the financial benefits of urban rail transit. Finally, through a detailed analysis of the successful cases of the MTR Corporation, suggestions are made for the development of urban rail transit in China. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

On the other hand, in real decision making process, not all the evaluations can be expressed by using precise information, fuzzy information may be more suitable to be used. The interval numbers are used to character the evaluations of inputs and outputs of DMUs, and then models are established to calculate the overall efficiency of the team. The interval efficiency of each DMU is further calculated with the condition that the overall efficiency of the team is satisfied. The method is finally applied in the efficiency evaluation of a logistics enterprise. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "GF-3 is the first Chinese civil c-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) launched on 10 August 2016 by China Academy of Space Technology, which operates in 12 imaging modes with a fine spatial resolution up to 1 m. The SAR images produced by the GF-3 satellite are rich in information and high-resolution. The study of the statistical distribution of SAR images has always been an important part of SAR image processing. In order to obtain high quality noise reduction and target detection results, it is necessary to accurately describe the statistical characteristics of GF-3 SAR images. During the statistical analysis of GF-3 SAR images, it was found that GF-3 SAR images have sharp-peaked and heavy-tailed statistical properties. Distributions of SAR images based on central limit theorem such as Rayleigh distribution cannot reflect the sharp-peak and heavy-tail of high-resolution GF-3 SAR images. Therefore, the sharp-peaked and heavy-tailed statistical properties of the heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution is used to model the high-resolution GF-3 SAR images. In this paper, an example of GF-3 SAR images modeling based on heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution is given. Modeling experiments on GF-3 SAR images show that, the heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution accurately describes the sharp-parked and heavy-tailed statistical characteristics of the high resolution GF-3 SAR image when compared to the conventional Rayleigh, Weibull, and K distributions. The sharp-peaked and heavy-tailed impulse characteristics of the GF-3 image were verified by modeling the GF-3 SAR images using the heavy-tailed Rayleigh distribution. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The proposed SSGL method aims to build a semisupervised sparse graph that can maximize the class discrimination and preserve the local neighborhood information by combining labeled and unlabeled samples. In our semisupervised sparse graph, we connect labeled samples according to their label information and sparse representation, connect unlabeled samples by sparse representation which set unlabeled training samples set as dictionary. Moreover, by setting sparse connections between labeled sample and unlabeled samples, the label information can be well propagated from labeled samples to unlabeled samples. In this way, the similarity of data points can be well modelled in the spectral feature space, and the data distribution characteristics can be better expressed. Experimental results on real hyperspectral images (HSIs) demonstrate the advantages of our method compared to some related feature extraction methods. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "For a change detection algorithm, a classifier is usually adopted to discriminate the changed portion of the difference map. This means the feature space used for the classification is very important in the procedure of change detection. To build an effective discriminative subspace for the change detection of SAR images, a two-stage based SAR change detection algorithm was proposed in this paper. Specifically, for the difference map obtained from two SAR images (before and after change), K-means clustering method was firstly adopted for the subspace dividing, while Principle Component Analysis method was adopted consequently for the construction of the subspace. Then, using the obtained subspace, the neighborhood of each confused pixel in the difference map was projected and re-classified with K-means method to obtain the final change map. In the experiments, using synthetic two-temporal speckled images, the parameters of our method were firstly analyzed in detail. Then, using one real two-temporal SAR images, the performance of our method was further analyzed and compared with some classical methods. The experimental results show that, due to the usage of subspace division and construction, a more reasonable result was achieved by our method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The modes have a 3:1 fractional frequency ratio and by increasing the amplitude of the lower frequency mode the synchronization range will increase. We show by increasing the amplitude of the lower frequency mode, the white noise in frequency and amplitude of the higher mode will decrease. We show that when synchronized the frequency fluctuations of the higher frequency mode will reduce 4 times in comparison with the fluctuations of the same oscillator operating at the same amplitude when not synchronized. The same amount of reduction is also observed in the amplitude fluctuations of the higher frequency mode. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Residential area is an important place for human habitation and life. Using remote sensing technology to identify residential areas is of great value for land resources planning and utilization, disaster prevention and relief and other fields. As the world's first high resolution optical remote sensing satellite for geosynchronous orbit, GF-4 satellite has high time resolution, medium spatial resolution and multispectral land detection capability, which provides a new data resource for residential monitoring. Closely combining with the detection characteristics of the GF-4 satellite, this paper proposes a remote sensing identification method based on GF-4 satellite, and the recognition ability of the GF-4 satellite to the residential area is analyzed. The remote sensing recognition of residential areas is mainly divided into four steps. First, Super-resolution image enhancement technology is used to improve the spatial resolution of GF-4 satellite PMS image. Then, the resolution enhanced image is processed by geometric correction, radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction. Third, the existing land use and land cover data are selected as prior knowledge to select typical sample areas. Based on the spectral characteristics and spectral relationship of different objects in GF-4 satellite image, decision tree classification method is used to eliminate the obvious non-residential areas such as cloud, vegetation, water and shadow, so as to reduce the subsequent data processing and reduce the false recognition rate in residential area. Finally, SVM classifier is selected for the classification of residential areas. Taking GF-4 satellite data in Jiashan county as experiment, the result shows that the user accuracy of resident recognition by this method is 89.96%, which is significantly higher than that without resolution enhancement in the same method. Besides, the spatial scope of the county and township residents can be effectively identified in GF-4 enhanced image. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

MRoMs are formed on SOI substrates and are comprised of a Thin-film Piezoelectric-on-Si (TPoS) micro-resonator separated by a thin oxide membrane from the backside cavity in which biological solutions are hosted. The isolating membrane reduces the liquid-resonator interaction and minimizes viscous losses to maintain relatively high resonator quality factor (Q) in contact with liquid. The membrane also insulates the resonator electrical connections from the conductive biological solution eliminating undesirable interferences. In order to minimize the added anchor loss from the membrane connecting the resonator to the substrate, in-plane acoustic reflectors are carved into the device layer around the resonator. Membrane surface modification with antibody and detection of target analyte has been successfully demonstrated for MRoMs. Frequency shift of 90 kHz (805 ppm) has been measured for a 111 MHz 3                             <sup>rd</sup>                              length extensional (LE) mode of an MRoM due to adsorption of anti-mouse-IgG molecules tagged with 10 nm diameter gold nanoparticles with surface density of 10                             <sup>11</sup>                             /cm                             <sup>2</sup>                             .

However, the backscattering characteristics of UHV power transmission line in a SAR image are significantly influenced by several factors including the span length and the radar polarimetry. In this paper, the effects of span length and radar polarimetry on the backscattering characteristics of UHV power transmission line are analyzed by using the high-resolution TerraSAR-X images. We first give a brief introduction to the imaging geometry of UHV power transmission line. Subsequently, for different angles between the satellite ground track and the extend direction of power transmission line, the effect of span length on the scattering characteristics of power transmission line is described. In addition, the intensity and pixel size of scattering spots, which are formed by the power transmission line in the co-polarized SAR images, are analyzed. The analysis results show that the span length mainly influences the distance between the scattering spot and the perpendicular bisector of the power transmission lines. Moreover, the backscattering from the power transmission line can be found to be much stronger in the HH polarized SAR images compared with the VV polarized ones. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "                             Accurate estimation of impervious surfaces is important but challenging due to the spectral confusion between different land covers. Recently, the synergistic use of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has shown advantage in improving impervious surfaces estimation. In this paper, multiple kernel learning (MKL) was employed to combine the heterogeneous features of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A data. Impervious surface was estimated at a sub-pixel level based on support vector regression (SVR) model. The impervious surface percentage (ISP) of training data was derived from high resolution image using the object-oriented classification approach. The results indicate that the combined use of optical and SAR by using MKL can significantly improve the estimation of impervious surface, since it not only reduces the underestimation and overestimation of ISP in urban areas, but also well separates bare soils from impervious surface. Compared with using optical image alone, the root mean square error (RMSE) is decreased by 5.5 % and the coefficient of determination (R                             <sup>2</sup>                             ) is increased by 8.8 %.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, since there is no consensus about the definition of forest degradation, it is difficult to operate its characterization, evaluation and monitoring. Unlike deforestation, forest degradation does not imply a change in land cover and it happens in fine scales and is difficult to detect by means of remote sensors. Images from MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-2, and UAVs form the main source of data for the national forest cover monitoring. The assumption here is that satellite images of different spatial and temporal resolutions as input may affect the measurement of forest degradation. The main objective is to study the influence of the spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing images on forest degradation patterns detected. Data of multi-temporal MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 for an area of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico were collected. Forests were classified into primary and secondary status based on the existing land cover maps and visual interpretation of the images. The obtained land cover maps with forests at different stage of degradation were compared to derive information of forest degradation and regeneration. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, the unfiltered exchange of the content and the missing protection of private information can lead to sending or broadcasting bully and harassment messages in different social media platforms. This kind of messages may have serious negative impact on a person such as causing low self-esteem and depression. Therefore, automatic detection of such messages is more than necessary. This paper casts the problem as a classification task and investigates the effectiveness of deep learning to detect online harassment in Large Human-Labeled corpus specially designed for harassment research purpose. To this end, models are considered namely Long short-term memory(LSTM) ,Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM),Convolutional neural Network (CNN), and compared with other classification models.

This study empirically assesses the long run and short run ties of such industrial revolution with CO2 emission and energy demand from 1971 to 2016. The study reliable its outcomes by applying diagnostics unit root, serial correlation, autocorrelation and normality tests. By applying ARDL bound test, the study reveals the positive and significant long-run linkages between industrial growth, services sector of the economy and energy consumption with CO2 emission, however economic development negatively impacted the emissions in the China. Granger causality reveals the unidirectional causation of energy consumption, industrial progression, and economic growth to CO2 emission correspondingly. It is intimated that the Chinese rulers need to address industrial waste to avoid environmental degradation, harmful pollutant stuff caused by CO2 emission. This step will guarantee Chinese sustainable growth in the long run and will produce a very effective outcome from OBOR project. Furthermore, the policy implication available for China as well as OBOR nations, to cater the environmental issues by making strict policies for industries and focus on renewable energy sources that help to lack the CO2 emission. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This is achieved through altering the substrate regions around the resonators, etching notch and reflector structures, so that the resulted acoustic cavity is virtually not leaking acoustic energy once the resonator is operated in vacuum. We experimentally prove our technique by presenting an 1100% improvement in Q for a TPoS resonator operating at ~82 MHz and achieving an f\\times Q of 2.6\\times 10^{12}. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Characterizing the signal by means of a self-made cross-correlator, a phase noise power spectral density of -170 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz Fourier frequency is measured.

        "abstract": "The MeerKAT radio telescope under construction in South Africa is required to tag the arrival time of a signal to within 10 ns of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The telescope has a local maser clock ensemble, compared to UTC by dual-band GPS receivers, and transferred to the digitizers of the array by an optical fiber system. In order to verify the accuracy of the end-to-end time tagging of samples, a portable instrument was constructed that transmits a periodic time signal. This GPS time pulse radiator (GTR) is mounted 10 m away from the telescope L-band feed horn, and radiates a broadband signal of -20 dBm. The signal is modulated by turning off at each UTC second, using the 1PPS output of a GPS receiver. The recorded voltage stream of the telescope is searched for the time signal and the corresponding timestamp compared to its expected value. While less accurate than the masers and dual-band GPS, this technique is simple and the instrument is easily characterized. Laboratory tests of the GTR showed its RF pulse to be at 1.65\\pm 0.1 \\ \\mu \\mathbf{s} after the UTC second. Tests on the telescope revealed a 13.0\\pm 0.3 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{s} deviation from the expected timestamp value. This was later found to be due to a buffer in the digitizer FPGA, and confirmed by pulsar timing. The GTR concept allows simple, independent testing of a radio telescope pulsar timing system. Future work is planned to improve the shape of the transmitted signal, to study GPS timing errors and correction techniques, and to process the received data using a more standard pulsar timing pipeline. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, the performance of any solution depends on the quality of the descriptor involved into the association approach. The most popular is binary descriptor due to their ability of matching with a high rate of matching in real time. In the present paper, we provide an ameliorated version of our previous work named local binary descriptor basing on 3D polynomial interpolation. The old version is reduced by the proposition of an algorithm of coefficients selection to deal with the real time constraint. This last is involved into a SLAM scheme named inverse depth parameterization for monocular SLAM. The result's quality is acceptable compared to the cross correlation in the old version of this SLAM. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "GaoFen-2 (GF-2) is a new high resolution remote sensing satellite launched by China. The fine spatial resolution of GF-2 makes it suitable for urban studies. However, the frequent occurrence of urban shadows in GF-2 images brings about great difficulties to the practical applications. Therefore, accurate shadow detection is a necessary step before applications of GF-2 data. In this paper, we propose a novel technique which combines spectral, spatial and morphological attribute profiles (MAPs) features for mapping building shadows of GF-2 images. In this new algorithm, the spectral features come from the original spectral bands, and the spatial features are derived from the texture analysis based on local binary patterns (LBP), and the MAPs are calculated based on the first principle component (FPC). Then, these features are integrated to derive a shadow classification map using a random forest (RF) classifier. Finally, in order to remove salt-and-pepper noise of the classification results, we use the majority voting strategy to improve initial shadow results by objects obtained from the multi-resolution segmentation (MRS). A main contribution of our newly developed algorithm is that it can effectively detect bright shadows, dark shadows and vegetation shadows simultaneously, and can remarkably suppress the spectral-similar objects including water bodies and low-albedo objects. Our experimental results show that this new technique exhibits very good performance in extracting building shadows under complex urban conditions, with relatively high precision: EO% of 4.51, EC% of 3.24 and ET% of 7.75. This study provides an effective algorithm for shadow detection of GF-2 images. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "For the calculation of bulk volume, the conventional method is to use RTK or total station to measure a certain density of three-dimensional coordinate points on the surface of the heap, and then use the grid method or DTM method to calculate the bulk volume. However, in practice, many objects to be measured are large or inconvenient to be measured at close range, so conventional methods are difficult to adapt at this time. In addition, the density of the coordinate points obtained by the conventional method is low, which affects the accuracy of the calculation result, and the cost-effectiveness ratio is low. Fortunately, in the field of computer vision, the Structure from Motion and Patch-based Multi-view Stereo (SfM-PMVS) technology is an effective means for low-input, high-efficiency acquisition of three-dimensional terrain data, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) technology has developed rapidly in recent years. Due to its low cost of use and convenient data acquisition, it is widely used in the field of close-range photogrammetry. Given the technological advantages of computer vision and UAV technology in the field of close-range photogrammetry, for the calculation problems of the pile volume of irregular shape, large-scale or inconvenient measure in the near field, this paper studies that using UAV equipped with a common digital camera obtains the target oblique image and then these images are processed based on the SfM-PMVS. Firstly, feature extraction, feature matching and point cloud matching based on PMVS are done for images. Then, image control points are introduced into bundle adjustment for obtaining the precise coordinates in the ground coordinate system. Finally, the DTM method is used to calculate the volume of the heap after doing point cloud segmentation. Compared with the result calculated by RTK, our method not only meets the requirements of actual production in reliability, but also outperforms the methods of RTK measuring points in terms of efficiency and cost \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The accurate allocation of public service resources within urban areas is an important task in the development of cities. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the matching between urban permanent population and public service resources. However, there is little analysis on the estimation of small-scale population and the level of public services. This paper takes Guangzhou as the research area, and the public medical resources as the research object. Based on the DMSP-OLS (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program- Operational Line scan System)night light data, this paper combines land use data, statistical data and spatial regression model of population estimation to deal with grid processing of permanent residents in Guangzhou. Then the accuracy test and the result correction were carried out to get the grid result of the permanent population in the whole city. And we use the improved Huff model, traffic network data and public medical service capabilities to calculate the allocation of public medical resources. Using it and the number of permanent population of grid cell as the calculated variable, we calculate the allocation of public medical resources and the matching degree of the permanent population in the grid unit, that is the matching degree of the public medical service level, and get more detailed information inside the regions. The results show that, regression analysis of permanent population by grid unit, and calculation of the matching degree of the level of public medical services, can make a more detailed understanding of the internal situation in the region, can make up for the low resolution of traditional demographic data and the high standard of public service differentiation. And a more detailed display of the distribution of the population distribution \"one main area, multiple core\" and the level matching of the circle distribution of matching level of public medical services. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Due to the short and simple way of expression on social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, millions of people share daily real-time thoughts and opinions about everything. This shared data generates an increasing availability of unstructured, informal and yet valuable information to data science researchers. Traditional approaches are not the wisest path for collecting and studying consumer behavior because they require a large amount of time and resources and therefore lead to considerable losses for companies. In this paper, we develop a system able to identify and classify sentiment represented in an electronic text from Twitter where users post real-time reactions and opinions called tweets; that are sentences limited to 280 characters about everything to improve the decision-making process for companies. To do so, we used tweepy to access Twitters Streaming API, we combined natural language processing techniques with naive Bayes networks to classify users data, we used GIS (geographical information system) and Matplotlib for data visualization and displaying the results. The purpose of this paper is to propose an efficient approach for predicting accurate sentiment from raw unstructured data in order to extract opinions from the Internet and predict online customers preferences, which could be valuable and crucial for economic and marketing researchers. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, this task can be complex in highly dynamic environments with various resources to allocate for an increasing number of different users requirements. In this work, we propose a Cloud architecture based on a multi-agent system exhibiting a self-adaptive behavior to address the dynamic resource allocation. This self-adaptive system follows a MAPE-K approach to reason and act, according to QoS, Cloud service information, and propagated run-time information, to detect QoS degradation and make better resource allocation decisions. We validate our proposed Cloud architecture by simulation. Results show that it can properly allocate resources to reduce energy consumption, while satisfying the users demanded QoS. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Hence, in this investigation, we are addressing the identification of Algerian sub-dialects of social media comments written in Romanized Arabic. Moreover, we address the Arabizi-French code-switching phenomenon.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the tackled problem on written documents. Accordingly, we propose a new corpus (DZDC12 corpus), and the general guidelines to collect the texts as well.As a first attempt to deal with the Algerian sub-dialects identification, we use two state-of-the-art tools of language identification (langid.py and LangDetect), as well as three classifiers (i.e. SVM, Multinomial NB and Gaussian NB) based on a heuristic of features selection. The evaluation conducted on the DZDC12 corpus showed low performances, as well as confirmed our expectation that the tackled problem requires an extensive study to select the reliable feature set. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The random time when the event occurs is called a change point. As the event happens, in order to mitigate property damage the government should increase the macro-control ability. As a result, we need to find a valid statistical model for change point problem to solve it effectively. Wavelet transformation method is introduced into financial market due to its convenience and simplicity. This paper proposes two methodologies which are Quandt-Andrews and wavelet transformation are to test the multiple change points stationary financial model in time series. We obtain the estimation of multiple change points, and compare the power of the two methods. From the real data analysis, the wavelet transformation method test is more efficient than Quandt-Andrews test. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Fortunately, due to the spatial correlation of the surface of the materials, it is feasible to improve classification performance from the perspective of superpixel. In this paper, a multiscale superpixel-based fusion (MSSF) framework has been proposed for hyperspectral image classification. First, several superpixel maps of different scales are generated from the hyperspectral images. Then, calculate the spectral mean of superpixels and each class of training sample, the label of the superpixel is determined by the label of the training sample which distance is closest to the superpixel. Finally, we use majority voting strategy to determine the final label of each pixel. The experimental results on two real HSI data sets show that the performance of the proposed framework is better than support vector machine(SVM), K nearest neighbor(KNN), sparse representation-based classifier(SRC). \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The electromechanical transduction efficiency of these resonators can be tuned using the two-dimensional electron gas at the AlGaN/GaN interface. The density of this electron gas can be switched by applying a relative bias voltage to the top electrode of the resonator, in a manner similar to a HEMTs. Switchable transduction is also demonstrated in electromechanically cascaded resonators, which are relevant for filtering applications. The transduction nonlinearity is investigated and shown to be primarily due to modulation of electron density at higher powers. Switchable MEMS resonators monolithically integrated with HEMTs can enable efficient programmable radios. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This latter is considered as a closed contour and generated based on Elliptical Fourier Descriptors (EFDs). The robots control consists of two stages. Firstly, robots move towards the desired closed contour using its Implicit Polynomial function (IP). The IP is deduced from the EFDs and considered as a potential function. The realized formation shape is considered as a virtual Structure modeled by EFDs, where a desired relative position is assigned to each robot with respect to the desired contour frame. The contour center is considered as the virtual leader that has a reference path along to a predefined target. Secondly, a controller is designed to allow robots tracking their reference path and eventually the time-varying desired configuration. The robots coordinate each to other by introducing virtual forces (linear springs) exercised from each robot to its nearest neighbors. The proposed approach is validated in simulation using different robots group sizes showing its feasibility and effectiveness. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The variation in quality factor (Q) and insertion loss of high frequency TPoS resonators is reported while the surface carrier concentration of the silicon layer is varied through application of a voltage to the metal-dielectric-silicon capacitor that is intrinsically formed during the conventional fabrication of TPoS resonators. A maximum of 3% improvement in the insertion loss (IL~9 dB) of a ~926 MHz resonance mode is recorded when a 4 V bias is applied to the said capacitance which is believed to stem from a reduction in interaction of acoustic phonons with carriers. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In the last years, several researchers have interested in two-dimensional (2D) palmprint recognition. In order to enhance the security of biometric systems, recently, some works proposed to use three-dimensional (3D) palmprint recognition. The advantage of using the 3D capture systems is that they capture the 2D and 3D palmprint at the same time, and they give different and complementary information. The 3D component contains the depth of the palm surface, whereas the 2D component contains the texture. In this paper, we proposed an efficient biometric identification system combining 2D and 3D palmprint by fusing them at matching score level. To exploit the 3D palmprint data, we converted it to grayscale images by using the Mean Curvature (MC) and the Gauss Curvature (GC). Feature extraction is made by a deep learning algorithm that is called the Discrete Cosine Transform Net (DCT Net). The experiments performed on a database containing 8000 samples show that the proposed scheme can achieve a high recognition rate. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "It has been established that the random-walk frequency noise of GPS-IIR rubidium (Rb) atomic clocks is driven by rf-discharge lamplight instability. Briefly, jumps in Rb light from the lamp result in jumps in clock frequency via the light-shift effect. These lamp jumps follow a compound Poisson process, and yield instability in the clock frequency that has an Allan deviation (ADEV) that mimics the ADEV of a continuous Wiener process. Quite likely this same mechanism drives random-walk frequency noise in all high-quality Rb atomic clocks, motivating means for its mitigation. One approach is to remove the effects of lamplight jumps in post-processing by measuring changes in lamplight brightness and knowing how those map to clock frequency via the light-shift coefficient. Another approach, and the one discussed here, actively stabilizes lamp brightness by controlling the rf-power driving the discharge. Specifically, we show that rf-power control can significantly reduce an rf-discharge lamp's brightness fluctuations, and that it can eliminate lamplight jumps defined by a compound Poisson process. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The OCSRC method is adapted from the classical multi-class sparse representation classifier (SRC) from an earlier work. Based on the spectral based OCSRC, the spectral-spatial OCSRC is brought up by applying the spatial-spectral features to the one class sparse representation process instead of the original spectral bands. The spectral-spatial features discussed in this paper includes Gabor filter, adaptive weighted filter (AWF) and collaborative representation filter (CRF). These features are calculated from the original image with a convolution process to combine the information from the neighboring pixels. Performances of OCSRC with these three features and original spectral feature are tested and compared with multi-temporal multispectral HJ-1A images acquired in Heilongjiang province before and after the flood in 2013, with detailed discussion with two sub-images and massive application with the entire image. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curve, which is widely used to evaluate accuracy for two class problems such as target detection, is employed to evaluate the results. It shows that OCSRC combined with spatial and temporal characteristics outperform the cases with only spectral feature by a lower false positive rate (FPR) at defined true positive rate (TPR), namely less detection errors, and lead to better change detection result. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The intervisibility of measurement control points in surveying and mapping work is affected or even completely unable to pass through, which brings inconvenience to the quality and progress of surveying and mapping work. Based on the analysis of field scene, this paper designs a new measurement method under the condition which between the control points are not visible. At the same time, it is also difficult to calculate the target point coordinates by the space resection method. This measurement method also solves the problem that RTK technology is of poor signal quality and unstable accuracy in densely-constructed areas. By taking the urban construction intensive test area as the research object, we verify the measurement method, and the error of the test result meets the measurement accuracy requirement. It is suitable for use in total station surveying, and is easy to operate and easy to use. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The results of the proposed models are compared to others recommended in literature that have had large acceptance in the oil industry.

This is necessary in radio interferometry, for verification, but has general applicability to many situations found in optical fiber transport. For radio interferometry one can use direct RF over fiber to transport the hydrogen maser clock source, and measurement of fiber to certain points in the cable system is very important. The long distance measurements are used to show that the thermal stability of the buried optical fiber cable keeps the propagation delay changes on the optical fiber link stable to less than 9.5 ps over 20 minutes, meeting a key requirement for phase margins for interferometry. The measurement method shows great promise in general optical fiber measurement for optical cables over long distances, with high resolution and dynamic range, enabling capabilities better than those offered by normal OTDR (Optical Time Domain Reflectometer) or OFDR (Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometer) methods. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

And because of various reasons, China's real estate market has three major features, that is high land prices, high house prices, and high vacancy rates.

This paper uses the spatial econometric model to test the influence of high-speed railway on urban-rural income gap through provincial panel data between 2004 and 2015 in China. It is found that, high-speed railway can narrow the income gap between urban and rural areas. And further analysis shows that high-speed railway can not only significantly improve the urban residents' income, but also can improve the income of rural residents, which is a Pareto improvement, and it can reduce the income gap between urban and rural areas as a whole. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Although there is a lot of ontology's in smart building area to resolve energy efficiency and other issues, we note the absence of essential concepts in existing ontology's. The miss of some user profile concepts may lead to produce an unfavorable result and lead to a negative impact on user comfort. The user comfort is an important factor to evaluate the energy efficiency techniques in a smart building. In this work, we aim to present a smart building ontology supporting the human profile concept. This ontology takes into consideration maximum concepts associated with smart building and human profile. Existing applications and ontology's related to the smart building and user profiling domain have been taken into account in order to create a general, comprehensive and extensible ontology. We will exploit human profile in reasoning to provide the adequate services in the smart buildings, maximize the inhabitant comfort, care out about human conditions and satisfy those needs. We will use protege 5 to implement our ontology using the OWL (Semantic Web language), and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) for energy efficiency reasoning. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Security in Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has become mandatory nowadays. This is due to the increasing use of mobile devices for accessing various accounts (e.g. Health record, Gaming, Facebook, Gmail and so on). Many researchers proposed biometric authentication in MCC, with a classical model for training and classification like using Local Binary Pattern (LBP) for the extraction of features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification and so on, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DeepCNN) outperform classical models in a number of cases. This paper aims to propose a Deep authentication model using Biometric Face Recognition based on DeepCNN in MCC. The proposed model uses the front camera of a mobile device to take a picture of the user and upload it to the cloud for computation (features extraction using DeepCNN). Due to the huge data and complex computation in deep authentication, we propose to allocate the training process to the cloud. The proposed authentication process achieves 99.50 % of accuracy. This method is implemented in Python using Keras library for deep learning. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, using ASTER imagery as the data source, a simulation method is proposed for Gaofen-5's four TIR bands' emissivity images. For the first 3 bands, emissivity images are generated through translation models built on spectral correlation between emissivity of Gaofen-5 bands and those of ASTER bands.

To test the feasibility of our simulation method, ASTER thermal infrared emissivities are simulated and then compared with their actual values. Average relative errors of these simulated emissivities are 4.04%, 2.98%, 1.74%, -4.02% and -2.79% in 5 ASTER TIR bands, indicating that our proposed method can be used for emissivity image generation.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

We select the relevant data from 2013 to 2015 of listed companies in China as a sample, and conduct empirical research on the samples. It is concluded that the performance levels of listed companies in China are different. We find that company performance is positively associated with executive currency remuneration and executive equity remuneration. Moreover, there are differences in executive currency compensation and stock incentives, and some listed companies face the problem of mismatch between executive compensation and company performance. The results will be useful to make a reasonable executive compensation policy when improving corporate performance. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The evaluation and analysis of ecological sensitivity is an important method to study the potential problems of regional ecology, and plays an important role in regional ecological planning and management of the region. In this paper, the study area was divided into extreme sensitivity area, high sensitivity area, moderate sensitivity area, mild sensitivity area and non-sensitivity area. Using the GIS and RS technology, 7 sensitive factors were selected from three aspects: natural ecology, urban expansion and ecological service, and relevant grade index system was built according to sensitive factors. Finally, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and multi factor weighted superposition method are used to obtain the results of comprehensive ecological sensitivity evaluation and analysis in the study area. The results showed that: from 1997 to 2007, the proportion of non-sensitivity area and mild sensitivity area increased by 3.91%, the proportion of moderate sensitive area decreased by 0.57%, the proportion of extreme and high sensitivity area decreased by 3.31%, the overall ecological sensitivity of the region is decreasing; from 2007 to 2017, the proportion of non-sensitivity area and mild sensitivity area increased by 2.38%, the proportion of moderate sensitive area decreased by 3.71%, extreme and high sensitivity area proportion increased by 1.32%, the overall ecological sensitivity was still declining trend. According to the ecological sensitivity characteristics of temporal and spatial variation in recent 20 years in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area results, further puts forward the ecological management and ecological protection development and management measures, provide scientific basis for the ecological economic coordination and sustainable development of green. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Soil erosion on the Chinese Loess Plateau is most serious over the world. Since the 1950s, a large scale of soil and water conservation measures (including the Grain-for-Green project since 1999) aimed at reducing soil erosion rates has been implemented on the plateau, significantly altering the land use pattern of the region. Based on satellite images, we studied the land use / cover changes (LUCC) of Huangfuchuan watershed, which lies on the northern Loess Plateau, between 1978 and 2011 in terms of land-use dynamic degree, land-use transfer matrix and land use degree, and briefly discussed the driving forces of LUCC. Results showed that (1) grassland is the dominant land use type between 1978 and 2011, accounting for 70%-80% area of the watershed. Unused land accounts for about 9% of the total area, followed by cropland(5.8%) and sand land(4.7%), and the area of other land use types was much smaller (i.e. water body, woodland, residential area). (2) During 1987-2011, the grassland area experienced the trend of decreasing first and then increasing. Although the proportion of grassland area slightly changed, the absolute area is still quite large given its original large occupation.the area of residential land increased In the entire period. the area of unused land, sand land, and cropland increased first and then decreased, and the area of other land use types fluctuated through the study period. (3) Before 2000, grassland, cropland, unused land and sand land were frequently converted to one another. Grassland was mainly converted to cropland and unused land. Residential land and woodland were mainly transferred from grassland and cropland. The increase in cropland was mainly a result of the conversion from grassland, water body, unused land, and sand land; The reduction of cropland mainly became grassland. The area of sand land and unused land has increased significantly, mainly as a result of the shrinkage of grassland. After 2000, the decrease in grassland area was mainly due to the transfer of unused land, sand land and cropland. (4) land use during 1978-1990 and 1995-2006 was at 'the stage of development', while land use during 1990-1995 and 2006-2011 was at 'the stage of adjustment or recession'. Overall, there was a considerable LUCC in the Huangfuchuan watershed between 1978 and 2011, and such changes are spatially and temporally various. They are mainly driven by a variety of forces, which varies over time and space, including the governmental policies, soil and water conservation practices, economic development, population growth and climate change. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Threshold methods are commonly used in traditional unsupervised change detection. Favorable change detection results can be obtained in general. However, this method is only applicable to the situations where the changed and the unchanged areas have high contrast. When the contrast is low, the change detection results can be seriously affected. The change detection task is formulated as a segmentation issue where the discrimination between the changed and unchanged classes is achieved by defining an energy function. The minimization of the function is carried out by using a level set method to find a global optimal contour, which can split the image into two mutual exclusive regions associated with changed and unchanged classes respectively. The complete energy function of the LCVLS (A Variational Level Set Model Based on Local Clustering) is composed by energy items using global clustering criterion, curve length, regularization item and the penalty function. Experimental results show that the LCVLS model is more effective than other unsupervised change detection methods. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

To estimate the annual CO                             <sub>2</sub>                              emission from coal fires, a thermal infrared and a color imaging device amounting on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are separately adopted to collect color and thermal infrared images over the coal fire areas in Majiliang Mine, Datong City, Northern China. First, standard blackbody is used to calibrate DN values of thermal imagery into the radiation values under the laboratory environment. Color and thermal infrared orthophotos are respectively generated by searching tie points and bundle adjustment processes, then Objects-oriented classification approach is used to classify land covers based on these high-resolution color imagery, subsequently land cover types associated ASTER spectral library are applied to estimate their emissivities. The atmospheric correction parameters are calculated by weather parameters (eg. Air temperature, humidity, barometric pressure) using MORTRAN software. In this case, atmospheric correction parameters and emissivities of land surface objects are inputted into the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE) in order to retrieve the land surface temperature of mine area according to the thermal infrared orthomosaic. We use an adaptive edge threshold algorithm based on sobel operator to recognize coal fires. We measured tens of concentration of CO                             <sub>2</sub>                              using a chamber over some fissures of mine surface, averaged them and investigated the number of fissures in situ, afterwards CO                             <sub>2</sub>                              concentration is transformed into CO                             <sub>2</sub>                              flux and the density of fissures are derived according to the areas of the surveyed region. The density of fissures is utilized to replace the emission coefficient of CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             .

Sharing, reusability and fusion of sensor data from heterogeneous sensor networks is not possible without understanding the semantics of the data. In this paper, we are interested in semantic interoperability of sensor data to design interoperable domain sensor Web applications. To deal with this challenge, we propose an approach based on semantic Web technologies which offers semantic interoperability for sensor data among heterogeneous WSN. For this purpose, we first propose a data vocabulary extended from SSN ontology to facilitate manual annotation on sensors, observations and measurements, by providing semantic metadata about spacial, temporal and thematic properties. We then propose to publish the sensor datasets as linked data to allow querying and analysis over collected sensor descriptions and sensor streams. Finally, we apply a reasoning mechanism on semantically annotated sensor data to infer and discover new knowledge, and answer complex queries. To illustrate our approach, we apply it on an example concerning the meteorological domain. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The ultimate goal is to converge to a better protocol that allows optimal energy consumption. In the proposed approach, some quantum computing principles have been used to represent each individual in the population in terms of quantum bits and to foster the search capabilities of the search process through an interference operation. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been assessed and compared to state of the art clustering-based methods namely Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy algorithm (LEACH) and another Adaptive Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. The obtained results show that the proposed approach optimizes, in an efficient manner, the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. They also show that the proposed method competes with and even outperforms the other methods. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, a connectivity reliability simulation model is set up when the ports along the route are under random attack by using the simulation method, and the reachable matrix is introduced to judge the variation of the connectivity reliability of the shipping network and the four heading networks. The container shipping network of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road was relatively reliable. Among its four heading networks, the connectivity reliability of European heading was relatively poor, and that of Southeast Asia was relatively good. In addition, using qualitative and quantitative methods to judge the node importance and implement the key node protection strategy for re-simulation, it can be gotten that the key node protection strategy is effective to improve the connectivity reliability of the whole network and each heading network. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Therefore, In this paper, we taking TaiHu Lake, the freshwater lake in China as study area, using the 6S, FLAASH, QUAC and ACOLITE four atmospheric correction algorithms of Landsat8 images and discussing the applicability of four algorithms in TaiHu Lake. The results show that all the four algorithms can be used under the premise of low precision, but compared with the other three algorithms, the average relative error of the 6S algorithm is 31.98%, this show that 6S algorithm is suitable for TaiHu Lake in the four algorithms; Compared single band error, the results show that FLAASH, QUAC and 6S algorithm are similar in the visible wavelength band, their errors at the wavelengths of 561nm and 655nm are in the range from 14.43% to 26.06%. However, the accuracy of the 443nm, the 482nm and 865nm band is lower than that of the ACOLITE algorithm, so the corresponding atmospheric correction method needs to be selected according to the required band to obtain higher accuracy; The relative error between the 561nm band and the 655nm band is the minimum; The ACOLITE algorithm has higher accuracy in the band ratio. It is suggested that the ACOLITE algorithm should be chosen when establishing the inversion algorithm using the band ratio, which can effectively reduce the atmospheric impact. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Their accounting data is selected as sample. The finding suggests that the cost efficiency on Chinese water industry is improved from 0.5581 to 0.5790 due to the reform of property rights. Besides, there is still a 35% cost inefficiency among the sample enterprises. Since inefficiency exists, there is an opportunity to improve cost efficiency on Chinese water utilities. In addition, the empirical results explicate that the debt asset ratio, independent director size and per capita GDP will significantly and positively affect cost efficiency. The ratio of state owned assets and market concentration are negatively correlated with cost efficiency. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

For these reasons, we propose to tackle the problem of mining frequent itemsets by mean of Chemical Reaction Optimization metaheuristic without the need to specify minsup threshold. The results show that the proposed approach gives good results and it can be used as alternative to mine frequent itemsets. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In 2002, a group of Chinese astronomers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) presented this new concept. The function of CAPS demonstration system was checked and measured in June 2005. The time accuracy of CA-code is 160 ns. The time accuracy of P-code is 13 ns. From 2010 to 2017, CAPS developed from the verification system to the experimental system. CAPS experimental system is used for satellite navigation and technical experiment. It provides a real and space-ground integrated experimental environment, and fully supports the development of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). In August 2017, the function of CAPS experimental system was checked and measured. The results are as follow: The uncertainty of time transfer is 2.87ns (95                             <sup>%</sup>                             ) in Beijing, and the uncertainty of time transfer is 3.96ns (95%) in Xi'an. This paper describes the structure and working princip[le of CAPS experimental system, and analyzes the technical characteristics. We analyzed the difference between the CAPS verification system and the experimental system. We foclused on the th method of CAPS system timing test. At last, we give the system test results and make a particular analysis.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

We cooled it to its thermal expansion turning point, measured at 18.1 K, with a pulse-tube based cryocooler. Thanks to the thermal filtering and the temperature control of the cavity, the temperature induced fractional frequency instability is below the thermal noise up to 1000 s of integration time. We also discuss the vibration induced limitations, the thermal characterization of the cryocooler and the digital servo implementation and performances. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

With the multi-electrodes configuration, multiple frequencies output of 56-176 MHz with high quality factor (Q) around 10000 are attained for a 37 \\mu\\mathrm{m}-radius disk resonator in atmosphere, which has a potential application in tunable multi-frequency RF oscillators and filters. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

To further suppress the residual cavity pulling effect, we propose a preliminary cavity stabilization scheme where two independent systems are built and their good cavity signals are locked to each other, thus realizing the locking of cavity length.

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral processing technology becomes one of the most focused issues in remote sensing field. In the hyperspectral classification, significant improvements have been achieved by various deep learning methods. In general, deep learning algorithms adopt a cascade of layers to extract the hierarchical features. However, the deep hierarchical property will cause some defects such as overfitting and gradient vanishing. In this paper, a hybrid method based on CapsNet and Triple-GANs has been explored to avoid overfitting and extract the effective features. Unlike ordinary CNN, the CapsNet is the consist of a group of capsules with vectorizing the activation output which could consider not only spectral deep features but also the relative locations of these features. The Triple-GANs is a game system with three players: a generator, a classifier and a discriminator. When the Triple-GANs converges to balance, the credible labelled samples could been obtained by the generator which boost the CapsNet in the classification task. The main contents are as follows: 1)By introducing the CapsNet in the hyperspectral feature extraction, the 2D convolution operations are replaced by 1D to adapt the pixel-wised spectral features. 2) Use the Triple-GANs and CapsNet to do the hyperspectral classification on small training dataset. Experimental results show that this algorithm can obviously improve the performance of classification compared with the traditional methods. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Successful ship detection relies on both payload imaging performance and smart onboard data processing techniques. In this study, a multistage ship detection algorithm is proposed, where the spectral, spatial and geometric properties of suspected ships are exploited for effective maritime target mapping. Multispectral images produced by the Landsat OLI and the Sentinel 2 MSI sensors of four locations were used in this study and they present a variety of scenarios that a ship detection algorithm could face. We observed that the NIR and SWIR bands produced a higher number of correctly detected ships when compared to the visible spectral bands and that the spatial resolution had a more significant impact than spectral resolution on true target detection levels. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, internet becomes very vital for any kind of information exchange. One of application which can uses internet for information exchange is the electronic voting (e-voting). Indeed, e-voting has several advantages like the accessibility for the disabled and elderly; the ease of long-distance voting; the low costs and the greater voter turnout. Thus, the challenge that oppose e-voting process are the need of securing the transmitted information which include the voters data as well as the chosen candidates. In this paper, we propose a secure crypto-biometric scheme dedicated to online e-voting system. The fuzzy commitment concept associated with the palmprint (PLP) and palm-vein (PLV) is the core of our system. In this study, to enhance the discriminating capability of the PLP and/or PLV feature vectors, we use Gabor filter with thresholding method. After that, the information, which will be sent, is encrypted using a random key which is then embedded in a biometric feature vector using a fuzzy commitment scheme. Then, in the central election server, the embedded encryption key is extracted using a new retrieval scheme, which is then used to decrypt the transmitted information before be processed. The experimental results showed that online e-voting based crypto-biometric system has higher performances in terms of accuracies and key retrieval. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

There are obvious differences in the inversion effects with different vertical wavenumber. This paper defined the impact of vertical wavenumber on forest height inversion. 39 groups of simulated data and 8 groups of real E-SAR data with vertical wavenumber gradient change were used respectively on analyzing the impact of vertical wavenumber on interference coherence and coherent matrix range. And for each groups of data, the forest height inversions were accomplished with three-stage method based on RVoG model. The experimental results show that: 1) When the vertical wavenumber was small (kz<0.06), the interference coherence and the ratio of coherence matrix range of data were relatively small, the data independence was bad, and the decorrelation was serious, so the forest height inversion can not be carried out. 2) When the vertical wavenumber was larger than 0.06, the interference coherence and the ratio of coherence matrix range of data decreased with the increased of vertical wavenumber. The reliability of inversion results decreased gradually, and the decorrelation increased. 3) Optimal vertical wavenumber interval of forest height inversion was 0.06 to 0.10, and the inversion error was less than 15%. When the vertical wavenumber increased further, the inversion error increased significantly, which was not suitable for forest height inversion. We conclude that the data with vertical wavenumber between 0.06 and 0.10 can acquire desirable forest height inversion accuracy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this presentation, we discuss how an EFD responds to an angle-modulated signal in general and demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that different modulation scenarios lead to different EFD output characteristics. In practice, such effects can help differentiate certain types of phase and frequency modulations, which is often difficult to accomplish with direct measurement of power spectral density (PSD). In addition, we show EFD-aided PSD measurement allows for quantitative assessment of wideband frequency-modulation parameters, such as modulation frequency, modulation index and frequency deviation, which is not possible with any conventional spectral analysis methods. The enhanced spectral specificity may benefit the field of frequency control by helping system designers more effectively identify potential fluctuation sources and their scales. The technique may also find applications in modulation recognition, radar technologies, laser frequency metrology, microwave photonics, etc. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Satellite radar altimetric waveforms conform to Brown model over open oceans but are unconformable in coastal regions because of non-Gaussian distribution of the reflecting surface and the effects of topography and geophysics. The radar return is irregular and contains more noises. The ocean waveforms were simulated based on the Brown-Hayne model and the coastal waveforms were simulated by adding different noise into Brown-Hayne model. The appropriate ratio of coastal waveforms and ocean waveforms was chosen to construct the waveform series over tracks from sea to land and from land to sea, respectively. The singular spectrum analysis (SSA) was used to extract principal components of the waveform series and reconstruct new series by linearly combining the selected components. Then several waveform retracking algorithms were used to retrack the original series and reconstructed series respectively. According to the comparison of retracking gates of the two-waveform series, the SSA played an important role in waveform denoising and waveform restoration. The results showed that the combination of SSA and retracking methods could effectively estimate the mid-point of leading edge, which could improve the altimetry data quality over coastal seas. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A typical BDS-3 global system receiver was selected in this work. By analyzing its characteristics, we put forward the absolute calibration method, and used a simulator to measure the receiver delay with and without 1PPS input. The results show that channel delays are better than \u00b10.1ns, the inter-frequency deviation is less than 2ns without 1PPS input. While with 1PPS input, the receiver delay increases with the increasing of phase relation between 1PPS and 10MHz (TtP) accordingly in continuous test. Meanwhile, under power on-off test (also with 1PPS input), the receiver delay varies periodically. To verify the calibration results, homologous zero baseline test were performed. In addition, we analyzed the calibration accuracy. The combined uncertainty of B1, B2 and B3 is 1.24, 1.24 and 0.58, respectively. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper propose descriptors based on the SIFT (Scale invariant features) combined with SVM linear classification. To build a powerful image classifier using very little training data, image augmentation is usually required to boost the performance of the classification. For this reason, an augmentation data is used to increase the training data for the SVM (Support vector Machine) classifier. The creation of the training data is done using several techniques of augmentation: anisotropic filter. We report a first evaluation of the CBIR (Content based image retrieval) and the second evaluation of the system aims to compare the deep learning with the boosted SVM classification. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Here we propose a compact design of a transportable Calcium optical frequency standard with the purpose of realizing a long time running optical clock. The design consists of an electronic cabinet and an optical cabinet. The total volume designed is 1.2 m                             <sup>3</sup>                             , with the electronic cabinet 0.8 m                             <sup>3</sup>                             and the optical cabinet 0.4 m                             <sup>3</sup>                             . It is designed to achieve a short term instability of 5\\times 10^{-14}\\ \\tau^{-1/2} (1-1000s) and a mean time between failures (MTBF) of 8 hours. It may have the potential to be used as an optical timekeeping clock with the long term instability and MTBF optimized.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Then it calculates the comprehensive scores of product ratings and reviews for positive feedback; the comprehensive scoring data is used to establish a collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, and a final recommendation list is generated according to the preference score. Finally, Taobao's online data is used to verify the proposed algorithm.

It can be used as a sensor for measuring various geometric parameters. This paper presents an SMLD design for micro-displacement measurement. The laser diode (LD) is modulated by the injection current in a form of triangular waveform and installed on a mechanic scanning device. The target to be tested and the SMLD forms the external cavity. The light reflected by the target contains the distance/displacement information. The information is carried within the laser intensity and can be pickup by a photo diode (PD) packaged in the rear of the SMLD. We call this laser intensity as self-mixing interferometric (SMI) signal. A new algorithm is developed to retrieve the micro-displacement from the SMI signal. Simulation results show that the proposed design is able to accomplish the measurement of displacement under weak feedback with high resolution and great accuracy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

By means of feeding in two microwaves with different frequencies to selection cavity, we got initial atomic coherence with the population difference of 4.22%, and by magnifying this frequency shift experimentally, we measured it with the increase of compensation coil current, which verified the theoretical conclusion: this frequency shift versus coherent phase is a trigonometric function.

        "abstract": "Since the 1990s, the urban sprawl phenomenon has become very obvious in China due to the fast pace of urbanization. The DMSP-OLS image of 1992, 1998, 2003, 2008, and 2013 were used to extract the built-up areas of the eight provinces along the Grand Canal. Then we analyzed the spatial expansion characteristics of built-up area in the eight provinces. The night-time lights threshold for detecting built-up area is determined by built-up area in China Statistical Yearbook, and spatial precision evaluation is made by using the land cover products of ESA CCI. The spatial expansion laws, spatial expansion intensity and spatial expansion type were calculated. At the same time, the relationship between urban expansion and economic growth was analyzed by using the urban area-GDP elasticity coefficient. The results show that the use of DMSP-OLS stable light data can quickly and accurately extract urban built-up areas. Compared with the statistical data, the average relative error is 5.15%. From the perspective of the expansion area, built-up area of each province have been expanded, but the size of the expansion area is different. The cities in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Zhejiang have the largest area of urban expansion. The three provinces ' urban expansion area accounts for 59% of the total area. From the perspective of the spatial expansion intensity, the intensity of 1998-2003 was the largest. However, judging from the urban area-GDP elasticity coefficient, there was an inconsistency between urban area and economic growth during1998-2003. After 2003, the economic benefits of urban land use increased gradually. Urban land use in Beijing and Tianjin is more intensive. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The central bulk resonant body made up of single crystal silicon is driven into Lame-mode by placing the Aluminum Nitride piezoelectric transducers at the support of the bulk. Commercially available PiezoMUMPS platform of MEMSCAP Inc. is used for the implementation of the proposed scheme. The device is operated using a differential-in and differential-out setup for an enhanced overall performance. At the resonant frequency of 21 MHz under the operating condition of air and -30 dBm driving power, the device exhibits a motional resistance of 2.17 k\u03a9 and a loaded quality factor of 5, 500. The resonator is then connected to a lock-in amplifier with phase locked loop (PLL) to study its potential application as an oscillator building block. A phase noise performance of -112 dBc/Hz at 1 kHz offset and -119 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset for a carrier frequency of 21.14 MHz was measured for a PLL loop bandwidth of 90 kHz. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, along with the rapid economic development, China is facing a series of environmental problems such as ecological destruction, environmental pollution and land degradation etc.. It is essential to conduct an in-depth research on the existing environmental problems in China. According to the carrying capacity assessment of land and resources, using multi-source remote sensing data such as MODIS data, nighttime light data as well as the socio-economic statistics and meteorological data from 2002 to 2013, the evaluation model of the national ecological environmental quality is established based on the combination of multi-criteria decision-making algorithms and principal component analysis. The assessment model of ecological environmental quality is verified by comparing the evaluation results of two different models: environmental performance index, ecological carrying capacity and eco-environmental quality index. All of results have shown a downward trend. Lastly, the better relationship between the ecological environmental quality and the ecological carrying capacity is established. The R-squared reaches 0.5023 and the correlation coefficient reaches 0.7087, which reveals the reliability and scientificity of the ecological environmental quality assessment model of China constructed in this study. The results show that the quality of ecological environment in China shows a downward trend in general. The area of the eco-environmental quality index between 0.6-0.8 performs a downward trend temporally, and then it decreased to the value between 0.4-0.6. The boundary between 0.4-0.6 and 0.6-0.8 spread southward. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

First the Rb atoms are pumped from ground state 5S                             <sub>1/2</sub>                             to 6P                             <sub>3/2</sub>                              excited state by a narrow-linewidth 420 nm laser, and then decay to lower energy levels by spontaneous transitions, and immediately are pumped by pumping laser again. This process continues until the population inversion is established between 6 S and 5P states. Once the population inversion is built up, a Fabry-Perot type resonator, at a bad cavity regime whose cavity mode linewidth is much wider than that of the laser gain profile, is used to realize 1367 nm active optical clock laser output. As Rb atom 1367 nm 5P-6S excited state transition is in the communication E band, it can be used as a narrow-linewidth communication band optical frequency standard, which greatly improves the communication rate and accuracy.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Based on the VAR model, this paper empirically analyzes the relationship between transportation infrastructure and economic growth in Yunnan Province from 1992 to 2015, namely roads, railways, and water transport. The results show that the transportation infrastructure and regional economic growth are linked to each other in Yunnan. Also, different types of transport infrastructure have mutual influences. Among them, the highways and waterways dominate. Yunnan should focus on building and improving the construction of transportation infrastructure to promote the coordinated development of regional economy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study is to analyze the Dagu River channel migration and its change causes using multi-temporal remote sensing data since 1973 to 2016. The research was based on six periods of wet season's cloud free Landsat images which are Landsat MSS for 19731980, Landsat TM for 1992, Landsat ETM+ for 20022010 and Landsat OLI/TIRS for 2016.Ratio method and Modified Normalized Differences Water Index (MNDWI) method were used to extract the channel information because they can avoid possible shadowing by mountains and terrain differences. Human-computer interaction was then used to refine the result after the channel information were converted into vector layers in Arcgis. Furthermore, several characteristic factors were applied to describe the migration of river channel based on GIS layers. They include river's length, average width, river area, area change rate and river bend coefficient. Through directly comparing the changes between characteristic factors of six images, we achieved the final result of river channel migration process. The dynamic change of Dagu River channel shows different characteristics during different phases. During the period of 1973-2002, the area and the width of Dagu River generally showed an decreasing trend, although its length presented slightly change. Meanwhile, the river bend coefficient increased continuously. The river channel migration reasons are probably as follows: 1) Water supply decreased since there was an obvious increasing of annual temperature. As a result, evaporation and irrigation water increasd and the flow decreased. 2) The over-exploitation of Dagu River water resources for urban and rural water supply has led to the lowering of water level and flow reduction in Dagu River Basin. And it even presented zero flow in some river sections. For the second stage (2002-2016), the area and the average width of the river channel showed an increasing trend. The average width continuously increased from 220.41 m in 2002 to 395.35 m in 2016. The river bend coefficient is obviously reduced. The average precipitation increased, but there was a slight increasing trend. More recent changes have been attributed to improved hydrologic conditions as a result of river dredging, building sluice and dams, widening the river and curve cutoff works. The changes of the river are the reaction of natural and human factors. This analysis of research relating to the change causes of the Dagu River channel from 1973 to 2016 showed that human activities have come to be as the controlling factor. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Hence, it faces three major issues: noisy and short texts, multilingual texts, and similar languages.In the investigated work, we address the benchmarked problem of LID of Twitter messages, where we present an effective approach (HAG) to deal with the three difficulties. The HAG approach is a combination of a graphical approach and a statistical approach, and does not require a large training set unlike existing approaches of LID. Furthermore, it can be trained with any source of texts including noisy and short texts.The empirical evaluation was undergone on a Twitter corpus regrouping tweets written in 31 languages, while our proposal was trained on a small corpus of discussion forum messages. In addition, our proposal was compared with the-state-of-the-art tools of LID, i.e. langid.py and LangDetect, and the results showed that the HAG approach maintains consistently high performances (over 87% of accuracy). \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The urban agglomerations including Dhaka, Kolkata and Mumbai have experienced the most rapid increase of PM                             <sub>2.5</sub>                              concentration with the average annual rates of 1.08 ug/m                             <sup>3</sup>                             , 1.44 ug/m                             <sup>3</sup>                              and 0.79 ug/m                             <sup>3</sup>                             , respectively from 2000 to 2014. The areal extent of PM                             <sub>2.5</sub>                              concentration over 35 ug/m                             <sup>3</sup>                              increased from 15.2% in 2000 to 64.5% in 2014 in the large urban agglomerations. These findings can provide useful information for reducing human risk to air pollution and promote sustainable urban development in China and countries along the Maritime Silk Road.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

These parameters are assumed to be independent and irrelevant, therefore sensitivity analysis is performed using the local analysis method. Variation coefficient was introduced into this paper to quantitatively analyze the effect of these parameters on FLAASH model. Atmosphere model, ground elevation, view zenith angle, and visibility value have dramatic effect on FLAASH model's accuracy, the aerosol model and water column multiplier have little effect on the model. In addition, frequency resolution and view azimuth angle have no effect on the model in all four bands and four land types. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

As the distance increases, the propagated influence factors of the sky wave are also increased. What's more, the mutation of the ionosphere caused by the eruption of the solar flare will affect the propagation of the sky wave. So, it is possible to infer that the solar flare will affect the signal strength of the low frequency time-code timing signal. To verify the influence of solar flares on the low-frequency timing signal, the paper starts with the influence mechanism of ionosphere on radio signals, sets up the low frequency signal monitoring system, analyzes the influence of solar flare on low frequency signal, assesses the effect of space weather on low frequency signals in real time. Based on historical data and actual monitoring data, 4 typical solar flare events were selected to analyze the signal strength of low frequency timing signal during solar flare. From the result of observation experiment, we can see that the burst of solar flare above C7 level has significant influence on the signal strength of the low frequency continuous wave signal. In addition, the field strength response trend of the low frequency signal is also different, and they vary with the monitoring distance. What's more, the influence degree of the different level solar flare on the low frequency time-code timing signal is different. When the solar flare level is higher, the attenuation range of the signal strength value is larger, and the impact on the low frequency time-code timing signal is greater as well. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Remote sensing has become an important approach to identify and classify vegetation types. By using hyperspectral data, we could obtain more detailed vegetation information, such as tree species. This study mainly focuses on the identification algorithm of white birch based on hyperspectral remote sensing data. The results show that the proposed method can effectively detect the white birch with larch as the background vegetation. Using this method, we can quickly realize the survey of tree species in large area, which is of great significance for the study of forest landscape ecology \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, the GNSS international time comparison systems which are operated in National Time Service Center (NTSC), CAS and Chunghwa Telecommunication Laboratories (TL) are used for high quality and long distance Precise Point Positioning (PPP) time comparison study. Firstly the principle of BeiDou PPP is discussed and related algorithms are analyzed and verified. The time difference between local time and IGST is calculated by using the measured data of time keeping laboratories and the products of precise orbit and precise satellite clock from MGEX of IGS, then the time difference between NTSC and TL is calculated. The results show that STDEV of BDS PPP is less than 0.5ns, and frequency stability is in 10E-15 (1 day), the BeiDou PPP is almost same level with GPS. It is shows that the BeiDou can be used in nanosecond or sub-nanosecond level time compare, and can be used as the officinal method in the calculation of the international standard time in the future. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

At the meantime, hashing is promising in representing a high-dimensional feature with extremely low bit binary codes while maintaining the classification performance. In this paper, a novel sea ice classification framework based on PCA Bagging hashing is proposed to improve the accuracy of hyperspectral image classification. First, local binary pattern(LBP) features are extracted from selected spectral bands. PCA bagging is employed to generating hashing codes of the extracted features. Then, a piece of short but strong code is obtained to represent the features of each pixel. Finally, these hashing codes are fed into the extreme learning machine for classification. The experimental results in real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework is superior to two closely related methods. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Academic and industrial actors are engaged to develop the IoT service composition paradigm. Indeed, it enables the aggregation of IoT services to satisfy complex supplies from several application domains. It can also be used to develop original IoT applications in an efficient, flexible and dynamic way. This paper proposes an approach for IoT service composition using a multi-agent system where several agents are engaged to satisfy the user's request. Simple reflex agents represent services, links, and requests. However, goal-based agent stands for the reasoner of the proposed MAS. The SysML language and the Netlogo platform are used respectively to design and implement the proposed approach. The test scenarios show obviously the importance, practicability, and suitability of the multi-agent systems for the IoT application based on service composition. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Compared to the former satellite of ZY3-01, the ZY3-02 has improved its ground sample distance. In order to improve and assess the geo-positioning accuracy of ZY3-02, in this paper, we conducted the on-orbit geometric calibration and accuracy verification work. First, the errors source affecting the imaging model geo-positioning were analyzed, and then a calibration method based on look angle model and compensation matrix were introduced to eliminate the internal and external distortion as well as to improve the geolocation accuracy. Second, the virtual CCD model based on the calibration parameters was established to produce the seamless sensor corrected (SC) image. Finally, large numbers of SC images were selected to verify the geometric quality, including the calibration accuracy, geopositioning accuracy and stereo mapping ability. Experiment results shown that the positioning accuracy improved greatly after geometric calibration with being 1 pixel, and the accuracy of non-calibration images also reached to about 3 pixels which indicated the effectiveness of this calibration model. The elevation and plane accuracy in the stereo mapping experiments archived 3m and 2.5m with only few ground control points (GCPs). All these results demonstrated that the geometric quality of ZY3-02 reached a high level and could meet the requirements of 1:50,000 scale stereo mapping in China. However, as the changing imaging situation and inevitable random noise in the attitude and orbit measurement, the geo-positioning accuracy in fact fluctuated and suffered from the imaging time and imaging area, shortening the calibration period we found could effectively improve the geo-positioning accuracy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The embedded heater layer establishes a symmetrical thermal field to achieve good temperature uniformity, which maintains the oven stability and reduce the power consumption. In addition, the SC-cut crystal is utilized for the proposed miniaturized OCXO to further improve the temperature stability, aging, and phase noise. As a result, this 9.7 \u00d7 7.5 mm OCXO has achieved temperature stability of \u00b13 ppb across -40 to 85 \u00b0C. Furthermore, we also demonstrated the proposed miniaturized OCXO could be complied with Stratum 3E requirements. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Does absorptive capacity have an effect on external knowledge search and manufacturing companies' technological innovation capabilities? Due to the different theoretical perspectives, there is no definitive discussion on the growth model of the technological innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises in the academic circles. Based on the open innovation theory as the theoretical basis, what is the growth model for the technological innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises? This paper uses empirical analysis methods, latent variable mixed growth model and other methods to empirically analyze 305 manufacturing companies. The study finds that there are two different dynamic growth models for the technological innovation capability of manufacturing enterprises based on the open innovation theory: The growth model and the \u00bbU\u00bb growth model. Furthermore, it further examines how the duality of knowledge search, the breadth and depth of knowledge search, and absorptive capacity affect the two different technological innovation capacity growth models of manufacturing companies. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "                             To characterize the Asian dust storms, an integrated algorithm has been developed to detect dust based on spectral thresholds and uniformity texture tests with Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) observations. The thermal radiation transfer and Look-up Tables (LUT) with the assumption of single dust layer was estimated and modeled using SBDART radiative transfer model. The LUTs consisted of six parameters, including aerosol optical thickness (AOT), dust particle effective radius (R                             <sub>eff</sub>                             ), land surface temperature (LST), dust layer height (Hgt), water vapor (WV) and satellite zenith angle (Uzen). When the other four parameters were controlled, AOT and R                             <sub>eff</sub>                              were able to be retrieved simultaneously by comparing the brightness temperature (BT) and brightness temperature difference (BTD) in the LUTs with satellite observed BT and BTD. Dust events occurred in 2009 observed by the MTSAT were selected to test the retrieval algorithm. The GEOS-Chem dust model was also used and assisted in identifying the dust transport pathways. Finally, the results were validated with AERONET (AOT and R                             <sub>eff</sub>                             ) and MODIS AOT data. The retrieved results showed promising agreements with the validation products. This newly developed algorithm provided continuous (both daytime and nighttime) and detailed observations of the dust storms, as well as AOT and particle size information of the dust plumes.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

When a hardware or software failure occurs in the system, it causes a failure and we call it, in this case, a fault. Moreover, in order to allow the system to continue its functionalities, even in the presence of these faults, they must find techniques, which tolerate failure; the goal of these techniques is to detect and to correct these errors.In this paper, we introduce at first an overview of the basic concepts of distributed systems and their failures types, then we present, in a detailed manner, the different techniques that tolerate fault, used to identify and to correct faults in different kinds of systems such as: cluster, grid computing, Cloud and P2P systems. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The objective of the paper is to establish a statistical relationship between Coulomb failure stress and gravity changes triggered by the 2016 Kaikoura Mw 7.8 earthquake, New Zealand. The changes were generated using PSGRN/PSCMP program at a layered gravitational half-space. The analysis assumed that the evolving stress level in the area is stable before the Kaikoura earthquake. The study area is extended over the main ruptures and surrounded regions in the South Island; the change patterns were estimated at six depths of 0 km, 5 km, 10 km, 15 km, 20 km and 25 km. Due to the stress and gravity models, the change patterns of the two models were numerically estimated and statistically analyzed using different methodologies viz.; Descriptive statistics, Regression, Correlation and ANOVA. These statistical methods were served at 95% confidence interval to expose the linkage between the two models under the umbrella of SPSS 23 program. The different results can be summarized as: (1) Descriptive analysis result revealed that the positive Coulomb stress change is \u223c17 MPa and located at 20 km depth, whereas the negative change (\u223c59 MPa) observed at the depth of 10 km. Likewise, the maximum gravity change -7.67 mGal- was observed at 15 km and the minimum change value of 4.69 mGal occurred at 0 km depth, worth mentioning the epicenter located at \u223c15 km depth, i.e., the maximum gravity change happened near the epicenter and decreased away from the epicenter. (2) According to the regression model, if all variables are held constant, a unit change in the stress at 5 km depth is associated with 0.943 increase in the stress at 0 km. Also, we found that a unit change in gravity change associated with 0.930 increase in the gravity at 0 km. (3) The correlation results mostly showed positive strong correlations of stress or gravity models at adjacent depths and vice versa. (4) The final result from ANOVA method was obtained from two steps: the first, comparing the stress or gravity changes at different depths utilizing the omnibus F-test and post hoc results. The results demonstrate existing of significant difference in both stress and gravity models. Secondly, further analysis of the mean difference were done to provide specific group details. The research is a scientific basis for utilizing statistical analysis in this area, and it can be applied for similar research in other areas over the world. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, we present our work, which takes advantage of different technologies such as ontology and agent system for smart school management, especially in the classroom. This work is designed to help administrators to identify any activities that occur at the classroom level, such as tracking the attendance of the student or teacher. We use the ontology to model the context in an intelligent environment for facilitating information integration and knowledge sharing between heterogeneous knowledge and information sources in smart school. In this paper, we describe the interaction of intelligent multi-agent systems running on network, sensor networks and ontologies into the architecture aiming at increasing the management capabilities in smart school and generate automatically detailed reports of the environment with minimal time and effort. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, due to the development path, the vast majority of Chinese resource-based cities have begun to be confronted with a series of problems. Meanwhile, the decline of leading industries in resource-based cities has brought about economic and social problems. In this situation, the study on how to implement industrial restructuring in resource-based cities becomes a very important issue, and it is also the content and purpose of this paper. Upon analyzing the basic situation of Hengyang City, this paper then mainly discussed the city's industrial restructuring. The paper proposes the principles and the best mathematically derived mode of industrial transformation of Hengyang City. Using DEA model, this paper made an analysis on the selection of alternative industries in the industrial transformation process and proposed the significance, suggestions as well as the support system of industrial transformation of it. According to specific problems under study, some questions worth further study in this area were also discussed. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, they are prone to structural defects due to aging without routine inspection and maintenance. This study reports on the deformation characterization of cable-stayed bridges based on an improved bridge-specific multi-temporal Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) approach. The proposed method effectively integrates the Point-like Targets (PTs) selection strategies of Persistent Scatterers (PS) and Small Baseline (SBAS) interferometric processing, as well as the specific structural knowledge, into the data processing to maximize the spatial density and accuracy of usable signals. Moreover, the deformation characteristics of cable-stayed bridges were captured by analyzing the time series displacements of damage-sensitive points (DSPs) that identified according to the PTs distribution and deformation patterns along the bridges. The effectiveness of our approach was fairly presented by two case studies including the Haihe Bridge in Tianjin and the Stonecutters Bridge in Hong Kong, and the experimental results were verified by cross-sensor comparison and structural-reliability assessment, showing millimeter level accuracy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It takes advantage of a phase-locked loop single integrated circuit (IC) and harmonic generation with high speed CMOS gates. We use a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) IC to tune the final output with micro-Hertz resolution. An ultra-low-power micro controller that could serve as the clock controller is used to control the PLL and the DDS. All components are commercial off the shelf (COTS) with acceptable industrial support. The total power consumption is about 1.6 Watt with -45 dBm useful output at 40.507347996 GHz. The short-term instability introduced by the prototype is 7.3E-14 at 1s. The prototyped subsystem uses COTS demonstration boards for the sake of agile prototyping. There is still significant margin for improvement of the size and weight. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, the information extraction of typical opencast mining areas by using high spatial resolution remote sensing images is less studied. The open-pit Nonoc nickel mine is one of the largest laterites nickel ore in Philippines. In this paper, based on the data resource of high spatial resolution remote sensing images, we used the method of object-oriented classification with hierarchical multi-scale segmentation to extract ground object information in the Nonoc nickel mining areas. The qualitatively and quantitatively relative analysis between single scale and hierarchical multi-scale identification results shows that hierarchical multi-scale segmentation has better effect and the highest precise, and the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient are 92.73% and 0.9024 respectively. Consequently the hierarchical multi-scale segmentation method is more suitable to be applied to the information extraction of open-pit laterites nickel mining areas. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, there still exist a lot of problem about container technical norms, infrastructure standard, information criteria, and coordination with international container regulation, etc. Therefore, it's imperative to reduce modern logistical cost and improve logistical operation efficiency through the development and innovation of legislative innovations of double-stack container, semi-trailer, piggy-back transportation, companied and un-companied transportation. The author established an evolutionary game theory analysis framework and demonstrated that under stricter container legislation regulations, the container enterprises tend to adopt a unified container technical standard and operation rules which in turn, will increase logistics efficiency. The policy implication is that Chinese government should adopt a more up-down compulsory container standard and operation regulations which benefit the transportation and logistics industry as a whole. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper presents a new method for measuring alpha by using the dynamics of an SL with optical feedback. A self-mixing interferometry (SMI) configuration is used to implement the proposed method. The relaxation oscillation (RO) of an SL with optical feedback carries the information of alpha. Staring from the well-known Lang-Kobayashi (L-K) equations, we investigated the transient behavior of an SL with external optical feedback, and the relationship between SL' \\mathbf{s} RO frequency and alpha. By applying FFT on the transient waveform, the RO frequency can be obtained and further used to calculate alpha. This work provides a new technique to the area of alpha measurement. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Landsat time series images over Beijing area of three different years, i.e., 1990, 2000 and 2014, and total 83 scenes were used in this study. The results of phenology extraction from vegetation fraction showed slightly better than those from EVI, and much better than those from NDVI. It also showed that the characteristics of vegetation phenology in urban and surrounding areas have obvious differences in spatial distribution and among different vegetation types. The method provides an effective tool for phenology extraction and analysis in urban areas. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "At present, China has formed three world-class city agglomerations, they are the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei agglomeration. The integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration has received more and more social attentions. Compared with other urban agglomerations, a characteristic of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration shows that the difference of economic development is extremely large. Total factor productivity refers to the part of output increase which can't be explained by input factors. From domestic and foreign literatures, total factor productivity can be used to measure the quality of economic growth. Based on malmquist index, the change of total factor productivity growth can be decomposed into the change of technological progress, scale effect change and pure technical efficiency change. Therefore, in order to understand the regional difference of economic growth quality, the article makes an empirical study based on the data of 10 cities in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, the time span is from 2000 to 2017. The result shows that there exists a serious regional imbalance of the total factor productivity in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration. In addition, the empirical results also suggest that the difference of total factor productivity mainly comes from the difference of technological progress. At last, according to the empirical results, in order to promote the regional economic integration, this paper puts forward a series of suggestions, such as developing comparative industries, promoting traffic integration, breaking the barriers of elements and so on. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Finite-element-analysis (FEA) simulation was employed to systematically study the proposed design, which reveals that the Q-{anc} of this novel geometry (i.e., R6T20FP-w5 with Q-{anc} of 100000) achieved a maximum 83-fold enhancement compared with the pristine one (i.e., RNT10-w26 with Q-{anc} is 1200). \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It is shown that the ratio between the finger-pitch and the resonator thickness affects the turnover temperature of these resonators which could be predicted using this model. The CQLM-TPoS resonators fabricated on a 40\\mu\\mathbf{m} thick SOI substrate, are characterized and the measured TCF values are confirmed to be in close agreement with the prediction. A relatively high turnover temperature of >100\u00b0C is reported for a third-order CQLM-TPoS resonator aligned to <100> silicon plane while a turnover temperature of <20\u00b0C is recorded for the <110> counterpart. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

We made an empirical study on the influence of Shi-Wu high-speed rail on the urban accessibility change along the way through weighting average travel time method and the generalized weighing travel time method. The two scenarios are set as with and without the advent of Shi-Wu HSR. Then we make a serious comparison about accessibility between these scenarios. It is found that if we consider travel time as the only factor, the accessibility of cities with HSR stations will be improved significantly. However, if the high price of the construction and operation of HSR is taken account in, there will be only slight improvement in accessibility. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Fisher classification and distance measurement methods are classification method commonly used for remote sensing monitoring of forest resources. With the advent of the era of big data, there are more and more related studies, but there is a lack of research on the relationship between the two. This paper takes the botanical garden of Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Hunan Province as the study area. Five imaging hyperspectral images taken by the SOC710 imaging spectrometer in October and November 2016 were used as data sources. Four samples were selected from each image (500 sample points of Eucalyptus and 500 sample points of Pinus massonians in each sample). There were a total of 15 experimental groups and 5 validation groups. It calculated K-L divergence, Hellinger distance, Bhattacharyya distance, J-M distance and Fisher's classification accuracy between two tree species in each sample, and calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient of each distance result and Fisher's classification accuracy to determine the relationship between 4 distances and Fisher's. On this basis, classification accuracy model of Fisher was established using the sample with the highest correlation in the experimental group. The research conclusions are as follows: In the same sample, Fisher classification and four distance measurement methods are used to calculate the separability. The correlation between J-M distance and Fisher's classification accuracy is the highest, and the correlation coefficient reaches 0.96. There is little correlation between K-L divergence and Fisher's classification accuracy. In this paper, the estimation model of Fisher's classification accuracy is obtained. The fitting effect of the model is good, and the average value of mean absolute deviation in verification groups is 0.083. Research has important significance for the optimization of the distance measurement method and the Fisher classification. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Based on the measured data of propagation delay, the relationship between the propagation delay variation of the user group received signal is analyzed, the distance between the user is 100 kilometers. It is founded that when the signal transmission path is similar and the weather is similar on the path, the variation of propagation delay of the signal is basically the same with time. In view of the above analysis, a method for obtaining the high precision propagation delay is proposed, and the method is verified by the actual measurement data. The results show that the method compared with the traditional method can get high precision propagation delay and can reflect the real-time change of propagation delay. It is proved that the proposed method can further improve the timing precision of long wave system, and lay a solid foundation for the study of differential timing technology of long wave. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The performance characteristic of Bulk Acoustic Wave (BAW) resonators is strongly determined by their mechanical and electrical losses. Extrinsic losses are mainly induced by viscous and ohmic losses of the electrode. The ideal electrode material is a highly conductive and light material, which at first glance might comprise a conflict of objectives. However, the solution lies in graphene-a promising candidate as an alternative electrode material due to its outstanding electrical and mechanical properties and its virtually massless character. In this publication we show that graphene is highly suitable as an electrode material for BAW resonators and, moreover, is able to reduce mechanical losses to a minimum, resulting in a strong enhancement of the quality factor at the parallel resonance frequency. With a variation of the metallization design, which is needed for the graphene contacting, we come to the conclusion that the actual resonating area can be directly adjusted by a metal bar structure. At this juncture, the metal/graphene area ratio reveals an impact on both the viscous losses and the additional resonating modes. These modes can be successfully suppressed with a thin metal bar structure with a bar width of smaller than 6 \\mu\\mathrm{m}, resulting in improved admittance behavior, more than a triplication of the quality factor at parallel resonance and an increase in the effective coupling coefficient. These findings highlight the advantages of graphene and other 2D conductive materials for alternative electrodes in electroacoustic resonators for radio frequency (RF) applications. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The complexity of cardiac cine MR images and on the other hand, the diversity of cardiovascular disease require segmentation phase. This phase is an important step in the processing and interpretation of medical images. In this paper, a new approach for the segmentation of the left ventricle from short-axis cardiac cine MR images is presented. Our approach is based on three-steps: In the first one, we have effected a pretreatment using mathematical morphology to improve images quality. Thereafter, we proceed on the segmentation of the left ventricle, in this phase we combined between the region growing and the active contour methods to obtain the endocardial form exactly. Finally, the parameters were calculated for characterization, such as tele-diastolic volume (VTD), tele-systolic volume (VTS) and ejection fraction (FE) to predict cardiovascular diseases. The proposed method was tested on the Heart-database containing 18 patients. The results are satisfactory with excellent endocardial segmentation and a good correlation of 88% for VTD and 91% for VTS between our parameters and those of experts which shows the good performance of our approach which can be used to aid diagnosis. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, the Visible and Near Infrared imagery (VNIR) from the WBSI Level 2 data acquired on October 14, 2016 (the planting phase of winter wheat) and March 18, 2017 (the green-up phase of winter wheat) were selected to estimate the winter wheat planting area using the Decision Tree model (DT) at Binzhou and Dongying City, the core demonstration zones of Chinese R D Demonstration Project on Bohai-rim's Breadbasket. The experimental results showed that an overall accuracy of the winter wheat planting area estimation was about 90% at the regions where there were not cloud and fog contamination, which indicated that the VNIR imagery from the WBSI could be used to extract the winter wheat planting area at the regional scale. It was found that the Band 1 and Band 2 and Band 14 of the VNIR sensor of the WBSI was useful to discriminate the winter wheat from some rural residents, the remaining weeds and the others. In 2017, the estimated planting area of winter wheat was about 295419 ha and 64715 ha at Binzhou and Dongying City, respectively. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The integrated phase jitter from 12 kHz to 20 MHz is less than 160 fs. For a lower power consumption of 5 mW, the phase noise performance is -118 dBc/Hz at 10-kHz offset frequency, -142 dBc/Hz noise floor, and the integrated phase jitter is 212 fs.

        "abstract": "Beijing is one of the most serious areas suffered from land subsidence in China. A series of environmental geological problems, such as the elevation loss caused by ground subsidence, have become one of the important factors that affect the urban planning and construction of Beijing and the sustainable development of regional economy. In recent years, land subsidence in Beijing is still at a rapid development stage. In addition to the groundwater over-exploitation, the scale of urban construction becomes a factor for the ground subsidence. The engineering-environmental effects of multilayer, high-rise buildings have more obvious effect on the ground subsidence. It is very important to analyze the relationship between the building load and ground subsidence. This work would be beneficial to the reasonable planning of buildings, to the predicting and analyzing of the ground subsidence, and to the reduction the hidden danger caused by ground subsidence. The Floor Area Ratio is an important index to measure the land use intensity, and it can reflect the building load. In this paper, the Floor Area Ratio index is used as a direct index to reflect the building load on the surface. The new index is extracted using the building shadow information on the GeoEye-2 images. By establishing a relationship among the shadows, building height and building load, the index can be calculated. The subsidence data can be obtained with InSAR(Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technique. The correlation coefficient method is used to analyze the relationship between ground subsidence and building load in typical area of Beijing. The results show that the impact of the building load index on the ground subsidence has a small scale feature in spatial. The building load index has a good response relationship with the ground subsidence in the local area, but there is no such law on large scale. Among the build-up areas, the central business district(CBD) area in Beijing has a cluster of tall buildings. The accompanying huge-scale static load and construction dewatering stand out as a factor for the subsidence. It has positive correlation between the building load and subsidence at local build-up areas. However, the law may not be applicable to all regions that with complex geologic environment, engineering environment, land use and groundwater exploitation. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

To measure the impact, an error coefficient (EC) was defined as the ratio of LST error to radiometric calibration uncertainty. The EC was estimated based on a sensitivity model, with focusing on HJ-1B thermal channel. Generally, under a moderate condition, a 0.1 (W\u2022m                             <sup>-2</sup>                             \u2022sr                             <sup>-1</sup>                             \u2022\u03bcm                             <sup>-1</sup>                             ) uncertainty in radiometric calibration may result in an error of 1.1 K in LST retrieval. Further investigations on the spatial and temporal variations of EC were based on MODIS/Terra MOD11-C3 and MOD08-M3 as well as a yearly land cover product (MCD12-C1). In addition, discussions for urban areas were demonstrated. Major findings include: (1) the EC over urban areas located in low latitudes are larger than those in middle latitudes; (2) seasonal variation of the ECs over urban is visible, which is associated with the backgrounds of geography and climatology; (3) the EC differences between urban and non-urban vary spatially and temporally, which show significant contribution to LST retrieval, especially over the transition region of middle and low latitudes.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Suitable windowing and long-record-averaging for the SDR FFT, with and without phase-locking, provides a substantial cure. Metastability-theory is derived and found to explain long term persistence of spurs and collapse, and when they are likely to occur. For oscillator phase noise measurement, the dynamic-range is limited by the noise figure of the SDR ADC and not by its number of bits, provided that sufficient oversampling is used. Micro-hertz phase noise can be measured up to one hundred times faster by measuring carrier phase-difference against a free-running stable reference source suitably tuned to the source under test. A novel method of signal compression promises ~20 to 30 dB increase of dynamic range for phase-noise measurement of oscillators. The target > 150dbc at 0.lHz offset, using a low-cost SDR, has so far been achieved. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper studies the performance's changes of listed companies before and after the placards year and explores the correlation between ownership structure and firm performance. The result shows that the performance falls significantly in the takeover year, the relation between it and the first big shareholder's ratio is the inverted \u00bbU\u00bb type in insurance sample, while it is the \u00bbU\u00bb type in non-insurance sample. What's more, the manager shareholding ratio, the ownership concentration and equity separation all play different roles in the insurance and non-insurance sample. The above study not only reveals how to improve the companies' shareholding structure and avoid malicious acquisitions but also gives suggestions on how to deal with the subsequent influence brought by the placards in today's environment, revealing what factors contribute to the improvement of performance. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Any digital system relies on an accurate clock for operation. While a clock signal can be provided from room temperature into the cryogenic environment, a clock generated at low temperatures features both smaller system size and tighter integration with the remainder of the electronics. While custom integrated cryogenic oscillator architectures have been proposed, mainly for the generation of radio-frequency signals, no commercial devices have been shown to operate at temperatures as low as 4 K. In this work, we focus on cryogenic frequency generation with commercially available oscillators. Eight commercial crystal and MEMS oscillators, generating 50 or 100 MHz signals, were tested over a wide temperature range from 300 K down to 4 K. Although MEMS devices suffered from apparent ageing effects after several cooling cycles, the majority of crystal oscillators were fully functional even at such low temperatures. The oscillation frequency of crystal-based devices decreased by roughly 0.1%, while power consumption and signal amplitude were slightly higher at cryogenic temperatures. The phase noise and corresponding phase jitter were elevated mainly due to increased flicker noise; the best device shows a phase jitter increase from 350 fs at 300 K to 620 fs at 4 K. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Light pollution has become an extensive environmental issue around world and nighttime light remote sensing technology is an unique and convenient mean to capture artificial light of surface earth. This paper aims to investigate the light pollution dynamics at global scale from 1992 to 2012 through nighttime light remote sensing. The time series Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) are selected to be systematically corrected. And then, linear regression trend method, total nighttime light(TNL) index and change rate of total light (RCL) index are employed to explore and analysis the dynamic pattern of global light pollution. We find that: (1) in the longitude level, light pollution mainly ranges from 30W to 130W in western hemisphere. Moreover, the light pollution mainly locates in middle latitudes of northern hemisphere at latitudinal level. (2) light pollution in Asia and South America shows a significant increasing trend and slight growth in Europe, Africa and Oceania. (3) Light pollution in China, India, Southeast Asia, Belarus, Egypt, Iran and Italy, increase rapidly over the past of 21 years. However, light pollution decreases are mainly located in some developed countries, including America, Ukraine, England and France. These results can help us to understand global light pollution dynamics and assist government to make policy regarding to light pollution. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

We collected RD data from 20 China's new energy auto firms in the year of 2015 and 2016, the sales of these companies are ranked in the top 20 in China. The sample firms cover almost all of powerful state-owned and private new energy auto makers. Furthermore, we established a framework for assessing the technical innovation efficiency, which includes 5 types of variables as input indicator: HR inputs, RD investment, RD environment, technical inputs and enterprise scale; 3 types of variables as output indicators: Economic output, technical output and competitive output. Through using data envelopment analysis, we conducted empirical assessment of technical innovation efficiency, pure technical innovation and scale efficiency for China's major car producers in the year of 2015 and 2016. The results show that most of China's new energy vehicle companies are technical inefficient and generally state-owned enterprises are relatively more efficient than private companies. At last, we proposed some suggestions and advices on how to improve technical innovation efficiency for China's auto makers. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, a system able to treat and analyze the Visual Field (VF) images and Optical Coherence Tomography of the Ganglion Cell Layer (OCT-GCL) images is proposed, in order to help early detection of glaucoma in its early stages. The proposed approach is based on calculating the percentage of healthy, sick and dead regions of VF and OCT-GCL images. In order to carry out this calculation, we combined the thresholding methods with morphological operators and median filter to extract all regions. These algorithms developed were tested on a set of images of a local database composed of 58 OCT-GCL images and 21 VF images. The results obtained are satisfactory and confirmed by experts in ophthalmology. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "With rapid economic development, acceleration of urbanization and population growth, it causes many resource issues including soil pollution, soil erosion and unreasonable cultivated land use. More seriously, both cultivated land quantity and quality are decreasing greatly faster. Besides, with respect to physical reduction in the amount of cultivated land, the hidden decline in cultivated land quality is far more harmful to food security, ecosystem protection, and economic sustainable development. In fact, the quality of cultivated land is determined by the characteristics of different kinds of factors and the influence on each other. Therefore, an objective and accurate method of cultivated land quality evaluation is necessary and beneficial. In this paper, we analyze the association relationships of thirteen evaluation factors in the national cultivated land quality evaluation system by using FP-growth algorithm. According to the correlation results, we exclude those evaluation factors with high association relationship so that we can accomplish dimension reduction and improve evaluation efficiency under the premise of ensuring the quality of evaluation. Based on training and testing of BP neural network, the grade models of cultivated land physical quality grade are established. The methods avoid the influence of artificial factors such as experts' scoring in the model to determine the weight of every factors and some other human factors, so that improve the objectivity of the grade of cultivated land quality. Finally, we choose Guangzhou as a study area, using its cultivated land quality data for dimension reduction experiments. After training the grade models with massive data, we obtain the results of cultivated land physical quality grade in Guangzhou. According to the experiments' results, the accuracy rate of the cultivated land quality evaluation in Guangzhou can get with almost no loss. It can also show that the evaluation model of cultivated land quality given in this paper can be used at the case of that some data are missing or abnormal, and meet the expected accuracy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, the existing designs, such as the MAPE-K Control Loop, are too general (i.e. they lack sufficient details about the structure and the dynamic of its sub-parts) and are not using well established design models. So, using the Fractal Component Model, we propose a Component-Based MAPE-K Control Loop model. The resulted MAPE-K Composite Component is sufficiently precise and explicit as it highlights the detailed architecture and hierarchy of the MAPE-K and its sub-components respectively. In addition, the proposed model promotes the reuse and the sharing of components as needed. In addition, it simplifies the maintenance of the MAPE-K Composite Component by the add, the remove, and the replacement of its sub-components. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) is a promising active remote sensing technology can provide reliable estimates of forest parameters. Area-based approach (ABA) is appropriate for wall-to-wall estimation of these parameters. In this study, we employed an ABA estimates of AGB by predicting individual tree AGB distributions over a subtropical forest study site. The total plot-level AGB was firstly predicted and the prediction of individual tree AGB distributions was generated by a two-parameter Weibull function. Then the fitted Weibull parameters were further estimated by LiDAR metrics. In addition, all models were assessed by regressed against LiDAR metrics in coniferous forest models. Finally, the stem density for each plot was evaluated by the parameter retrieval method with predicted total AGB and mean tree AGB derived from predicted Weibull parameters of individual tree AGB distribution. The results showed that the AGB and two Weibull parameters were generally predicted well (R                             <sup>2</sup>                             =0.79-0.92, rRMSE=8.46%-20.80%). For stem density estimation, the regressed model explained 76% of variability in field stem density. The relationship between predicted and reference AGB distributions when the predicted frequencies of the AGB distributions were scaled to ground-truth stem number (mean Reynolds error index eR=30.83) was relatively stronger than when predicted frequencies were scaled to stem number predicted from LiDAR data (mean eR=33.67). This study demonstrated the distributions of individual forest structural parameters can potentially contribute to enrich ABA forest attributes inventory for airborne LiDAR.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Signal processing based on multi-stage exponentially weighted recursive leastsquares estimation (EW-RLSE) is utilized for estimating the concentrations of the analytes in the mixture that are most likely to have produced a given sensor response. The initial stages of EW-RLSE are used to eliminate analyte(s) that are erroneously identified as present in the mixture; the final stage of EW-RLSE with the corresponding sensor response model representing the analyte(s) present in the mixture is used to obtain a more accurate quantification result of the analyte(s). The success of this method in identifying and quantifying analytes in real-time with high accuracy using the response of just a single sensor device demonstrates an effective, simpler, lower-cost alternative to a sensor array that includes the advantage of not requiring a complex training protocol. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

By making full use of the intrinsic frequency mixing property of a parallel plate capacitive transducer, we are able to down-convert the oscillation frequency to 10kHz, an order of magnitude lower than the resonator's intrinsic first fundamental mode frequency of 157.5kHz in contrast to the standard approach relying only on a DC polarization voltage. With this approach, a minimum bias stability of 5.9\\mu \\mathrm{g} has been achieved at an integration time of 0.2s, and the noise floor is 1.7\\mu \\mathrm{g}\\mathbf{Hz}^{1/2}. Compared to DC polarized configuration, the improvement in bias stability and noise floor is 1.7 times and 2 times respectively. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Moreover, this technique is compatible is photonic integration, indicating a pathway towards a chip-scale low-phase-noise microwave frequency source. Separately, difference-frequency stabilization allows ultra-low phase noise microwave generation without carrier-envelope phase locking. In this work, we evaluate the challenges in implementing a difference-frequency stabilization scheme with a short-path-length-interferometer. We find that the combination of a short-path-length and lower frequency multiplication factor will exacerbate electronic noise contributions, influence the ability of the feedback loop to achieve lock. We also find that dispersion management is essential to generating usable error signals for single-mode fiber delay lines that are longer than approximately 4 m. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The spatial pattern of manufacturing agglomeration spreads from the surrounding areas of Beijing to the southeast of Beijing and the central and southern regions of Hebei province; the spatial pattern of agglomeration of Productive Service Industry has gradually spread from the central and southern regions of Hebei and Beijing to the northern part of Hebei. (2) The estimation results based on the three spatial weighting matrices consistently show that manufacturing agglomeration has a significant negative impact on TFP in this region; On the contrary, Productive Service Industry have a significant positive impact on it. However, the degree of Co-agglomeration is significantly negative. (3) In the aspect of space spillover effect, there is a significant spatial correlation in the TFP, that is, the increase of urban economic efficiency in this region will affect the surrounding cities through spillover effect. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Consequently, the computational costs of these methods are too expensive to be implemented in on-orbit platforms. To tackle this problem, first, a shoreline database is built according to the global geographic information systems; then, the sea-land segmentation method is proposed by utilizing the corresponding coastline data, which is obtained from the database according to the latitude and longitude of the candidate area. Compared to the existing sea-land segmentation methods, this method is more suitable for on-orbit platforms, because of the less computational costs, higher efficient, and acceptable robustness. The experimental results based on raw panchromatic images demonstrated that the proposed method had a good performance in sea-land segmentation for on-orbit processing. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Compared with the original remote sensing images, although the image quality was reduced and the spectral information was lacking, it has been able to meet the needs of this study. A method for estimating fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) using GE images based on K-Means algorithm was proposed. Firstly, GE image was preliminarily classified by using K-Means algorithm. Secondly, by visual interpretation, the initial classification results were further clustered into 4 types according to the number and brightness feature of land surface types in the image, low brightness (shadow), medium low brightness (high density vegetation), medium high brightness (sparse vegetation), high brightness (bare ground), the FVC of each category was determined by its characteristics and composition. Finally, weighted by the proportion of pixels in the image, took the weighted sum of the FVC of all categories as the FVC of the image. In addition, the field survey data were used to verify the FVC estimated by the proposed method, the results showed that: the precision of estimated vegetation coverage could reach 80% \u223c 90%. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Finite element analysis (FEM) has been used to show the estimate deflection at the center of the membrane. For the 20\\mu \\mathbf{m} thick, 2mm diameter membrane in this work, 1mPa of pressure change corresponds to 2pm of deflection (shear stress of 12Pa at the center of the membrane). Measurements show highest resonator sensitivity of 0.5Hz per pico-meter of deflection at the membrane center. In addition, it is shown that as the dimension of disks decreases from 20\\mu \\mathbf{m} to 5\\mu \\mathbf{m}, the resonator sensitivity increases by about 8 times. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper establishes an evaluation index system and model for regional economic development and allocation of transportation resources. The comprehensive level of regional economic development and regional transportation resource allocation were evaluated and ranked respectively by the principal component analysis and entropy method. Then, the Euclidean distances are calculated for each of the two systems in each region to examine the coordination of economic development and allocation of transportation resources. Based on the scoring of the two systems, the linear equations are fitted with the allocation of regional transportation resources and the level of regional economic development as independent variables to quantify the degree of influence between the two systems. The empirical results show that there is a close relationship between the allocation of regional transportation resources and economic development, and the two have a certain degree of coordination. However, there are significant differences in the degree of coordination between different regions. In view of the uncoordinated traffic resources allocation and regional economic development, this paper also put forward corresponding countermeasures and suggestions. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Evaluation of the influence of urbanization to the ecological environment can help us better understand urban sustainability and human activities. In this regard, in this paper, we carry out an integrated research to explore the urbanization patterns in a typical area, the western part of Tiaoxi Basin, Zhejiang Province, China, in period 1995-2014, and its feedbacks to agricultural production and local environment. This research is based on the time series of land use mapping with Landsat images, utilizing an object-based image analysis method by taking full advantage of remote sensing (RS) and geographical information systems (GIS) technologies. We developed a new environmental evaluation index (EEI) based on the vegetation cover area (VCA) and water cover area (WCA), derived from the land use maps, to monitor the change of local environmental quality. This study witnessed large land cover changes induced by a rapid urban sprawl in period 1995-2014. The urban area of 2014 increased to more than three times of that of 1995, after 20 years' high speed urbanization. As a result, a large amounts of farmland were occupied, which greatly affected the agricultural production. However, fortunately, the local environment was not affected much by rapid urbanization and was not obviously degraded in period 1995-2014. The EEI changed little with few natural habitats reduction during the period relative to vegetation and water, which was different from many cases in China and other developing countries. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Also, with the accumulation of labor mobility, there has been a feature that the labor force concentrated from the underdeveloped areas to the developed areas. The characteristics of high-speed railway (HSR) such as timeliness and regional accessibility can promote the process of urbanization, induce employment. Thereby it attracts labor mobility, and creates labor agglomeration. Based on the theory of \u00bbcyclic accumulation of causality\u00bb, this paper establishes the mechanism of the impact of HSR on labor agglomeration. We conduct an empirical analysis of the three cities along the HSR of the Beijing-Guangzhou line, and analyze whether the Beijing-Guangzhou line has an impact on the labor agglomeration. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Inspired by the idea of natural language processing, in this paper, we propose a local space long short-term memory network based hyperspectral image classification, which constructs sequential features in the local area of hyperspectral images. This method is based on the integration features of two traditional low-level features, and from these integration features to extract sequential features of the center sample in the local space, then use the long short-term memory network to learn high-level semantic features, finally use them to classify image. This method can not only obtain more representative and discriminative high-level semantic features, and through constructing the local space sequence to enhance positive impact of the useful pixels, inhibit negative effects of useless pixels, it improves the classification accuracy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this study, the diurnal and seasonal Landsat-scale data were obtained by using spatiotemporal data fusion (STF) method. We quantified the diurnal and seasonal SUHI and analyzed their spatial variations and possible underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrate the following: the annual mean SUHI varied markedly during the day and night, with a great deal of spatial heterogeneities. The SUHI differed greatly by season, characterized by a higher intensity in summer than in spring, autumn and winter during the day, and it is the opposite at night. Moreover, the negative correlation between land surface temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) showed an amplifying effect of the developed areas for SUHI, while areas with a predominance of vegetation attenuated the effect of SUHI. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

First of all, through the research of previous scholars, a new research model on brand loyalty is established. For further research, the first step is to verify the relationship between emotional reputation, cognitive reputation and consumer trust and brand loyalty. What is more important is to examine the intermediary role of consumer trust. This paper mainly examines how corporate reputation influences consumer brand loyalty. The application of Wen's intermediary effect test model mediates the mediating role of consumer trust. The results reveal a positive mediating effect of consumer trust between emotional reputation and brand loyalty. However, when testing the cognition reputation, the result is negative. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The form of sharing economy that is emerged by using many information technologies such as the mobile Internet, the big data, the cloud computing, the block chain, etc. profoundly influences and changes the traditional economic form of human society with the emerging economic formats in the information age. Under the background of the new era, clarifying the basic connotation, performance characteristics and main functions of the sharing economy can attach a great significance on better promoting the high-quality development of the sharing economy and building a modern economic system. It is believed in this article that the connotation of the sharing economy can be grasped from the scope of development, motivation, ideas and models. The sharing economy has the characteristics of rapid development, diversified subjects, clear operating mechanism and differences in economic composition. We then derive 9 variables with almost equal importance which reflect the development of sharing economy through Factor Analysis. The development of sharing economy has entered a new era. While promoting the development of shared economy, we should promote the deep integration of new and old formats, foster the sharing of information and cultural genes, build a pragmatic and invasive system, apply an inclusive and prudent regulatory system, and create a social environment of joint construction and sharing. This article helps to deepen the understanding of the sharing economy and has certain reference value for theoretical research and practical development in this field. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Subway underground construction generally carried out at urban downtown areas. It has various buildings and facilities, and complicated underground pipe network condition. Underground projects such as the construction of new metro line and deep foundation pit excavation will cause damage to the geological environment which has balance stress. And it also easily lead to deformation in the project construction area, and even surface collapse. Therefore, it is of great significance for the regular deformation monitoring of the surrounding environment during the construction of the metro line. Taking Beijing Metro Line 6 (Phase II) as the research object, 33 scenes TerraSAR-X data in 2011-2015 were collected, and IPTA technology was used to obtain the deformation results in the study area. The spatial statistics method was used to analyze the results of InSAR, and the reliability of the results was evaluated. And with the leveling results as a standard, the accuracy of the deformation results was evaluated. Based on the achievement of InSAR, combined with geological structure, hydrogeology, engineering geology, groundwater information and engineering construction progress, etc, the rule of settlement development along Beijing Metro Line 6 (Phase II) was studied to explore the impact of railway engineering on the surrounding environment. The research show that the deformation results obtain by IPTA technology can achieve high precision. Compared with leveling results, the absolute deviation is less than 10mm/year and the standard deviation is within 6mm/year. Beijing Metro Line 6 (Phase II) project passes through the key subsidence area of Beijing. The Section analysis method was used to extract the deformation profile, so as to express the degree of uneven settlement by the gradient of the profile. As a result, the fluctuation of uneven degree was presented along the surface line, and some sections have higher values. Overlaying the engineering geological profile of subway lines and the location information of subway stations, it was found that the excavation of subway station has a great impact on the surrounding environment, and the influence is more obvious with the increase of clay layer thickness. The groundwater level along the Line 6 (Phase 2) gradually increased from Caofang Station to Dongxiaoying Station. Overall, the sedimentation rate of low groundwater level is higher. The deformation monitoring of underground rail transit surrounding environment based on multi-discipline crossing is conducive to guiding engineering construction and engineering operation protection. It is significanct to the safety of railways. This research can also provide reference for other subway construction and monitoring. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "As an important carrier of material cultural heritage, historical building groups (HBGs) in ancient villages full of historical imprint and architectural aesthetics value. However, the historical building groups undermines from natural and human activities constantly, thus the 3D digital protection for the historical building groups being of great urgency. Aiming at 3D real modeling for historical building groups in ancient villages with high-precise and fine real simulation, this paper put forward a technology process based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) Remote Sensing(RS) and Ground RS technology. During the RS image acquisition, low-altitude RS images acquired by Remote Sensor on Multi-rotor UAV and ground RS images acquired by Remote Sensor on 3-Axis Handheld Stabilized Camera. In the technology process, firstly, the Relative Orientation(RO) of ground RS images solved by Automatic Vertical Aerial Triangulation(AV-AT), the Exterior Orientation(EO) of ground RS images solved by Rigid Registration with the production of AV-AT and Photo Control Point(PCP); Secondly, the EO of low altitude RS images solved by Rigid Registration with PCP and Photo Position Metadata; finally, based on the above EO, Context Capture conduct 3D real modeling process, in which contains supplemental images matching, colored point cloud generating, point cloud optimization, TIN generating and texture mapping. The technology process applied in the 3D real modeling of a typical historical village in Dongguan, and the precision of production was evaluated by geometry measurement. In the 3D real modeling results of large cultural heritage, preliminary experiments shows that the precision of geometry and the spatial resolution of texture mapping is generally better than the Grade I according to the Specification for the Digital Products of 3D Model on Geographic Information. Therefore, the technology process achieves the integrating low-altitude RS images with ground RS images, makes full use of the advantages of different position of the RS from ground and low-altitude, and it is able to acquire more complete image information for large cultural heritages, with obvious advantages in building a 3D real scene model in high accuracy and good recovery. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In recent years, the availability of airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and high spatial resolution (HSR) imagery makes it possible to generate land cover information at fine scales. In this study, we proposed an object-based image analysis (OBIA) method to derive 1m resolution land cover classification from airborne LiDAR and multi-spectral image data. A series of rules were developed for identifying 7 land cover features (low impervious cover, buildings, shrub/tree, grass, soil/rock, rivers/lakes, and swimming pool). Experiments were performed in two sites in Richland County, South Carolina, USA. The classification results yielded an overall accuracy of 92.23% and a kappa coefficient of 0.8996. Confusion occurs between soil/rock and grass land and low impervious surface due to their spectral similarity. The algorithm shows promise for large-area classification in forested urban landscapes with similar datasets. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

To cover the entire targeted frequency range (0-10kHz), two different device configurations, both utilizing piezoresistive strain gauges on microscale cantilevers, have been fabricated using a standard CMOS process with minimal mask-less post-CMOS micro-machining. Sensitivities as high as 9.73mV/g (at DC for 1mW of power consumed) and 14.

However, the kernel ELM (KELM) is increasingly gaining attentions in hyperspectral image(HSI) classification, due to its robustness. The widely used RBF kernel in KELM has achieved promising classification performance in hyperspectral image(HSI) classification, but the underlying data structure of the hyperspectral image is not taken into consideration. In this paper, we propose a novel spectral-spatial KELM method by incorporating the mean filtering (MF) kernel into the KELM model, which can properly compute the average of the spatial neighboring pixels in the kernel space. Experimental results on real hyperspectral datasets show that, the proposed method outperforms others kernel based KELM method, in terms of both computational efficiency and classification accuracy in HSI supervised classification. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Whereas, task scheduling is a critical part of resource allocation. In this paper, we have used a metaheuristic approach called Electromagnetism Meta-heuristic Algorithm (EMA). We specifically designed EMA to minimize the makespan of execution tasks on virtual machines (VMs) as well, we study its impact on the availability of resources. Simulation results revealed that EMA gave eligible results closer to PSO. But, it allows a better availability of VMs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The combination of different sub-classifiers is combined by cascading and parallel connection, and the voting rules based on prior knowledge are used to achieve the accurate classification of remote sensing images. Taking Yueyang TM remote sensing image as experimental research object, multiple classifiers combination method is applied to classify processing, and the processing result is compared with the result of single classifier. Through error matrix comparison, we can see that the accuracy of Kappa coefficients of multiple classifiers is better than that of single classifiers. Compared with classification results, multiple classifier's effect is better than single classifier in detail results. The research results show that the combined classifier is much better than the single classifier in the classification of remote sensing images, and has better expansibility, which has wider application prospects in the field of geographical condition monitoring \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Most CNN-based SISR methods used the default L2 norm of the error. However, for Hyperspectral Image (HSI), this loss function may bring spectral inconsistencies. The main reason is that most methods did not pay much attention to spectral loss. To HSI, the loss function should capture not only spatial information but also spectral consistency. In this paper, a Multi-Losses Function Network (MLFN) simultaneously considering spatial and spectral information is proposed, and is composed of two parts: one is Concatenate Dense Residual Network (CDRN), and the other is Loss Network (LN). CDRN is an image reconstruction network which can utilize the hierarchical features extracted from the low-resolution image. LN includes pixel-wise spatial loss and spectral loss which drive the learning of the entire reconstruction model. The experimental results prove that the proposed MLFN can enhance spatial resolution with the consistency of the spectrum of HSI preserved. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The secondary forests in southeast China are carbon-dense, species-rich ecosystems with high productivity, play a key role in maintaining regional environment and mitigating climate change. In this study, we assessed the capacity of bi-temporal airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to predict forest volume change in a secondary forest of southeast China over a 6-year period. To do so, we evaluated four different approaches for estimating the change in volume, specifically: (1) predicting volume for Time 1 by the model fitted by the field and LiDAR data in Time 2, volume change was then calculated as the difference between the predicted volume from the two times; (2) predicting change using the differences of LiDAR metrics; (3) predicting change as the difference between separate volume predictions; and (4) predicting change using the LiDAR metrics from each point in time. The results demonstrated that, in general, Method 2 and 4 have higher accuracy than Method 1 and 3. Compared with the results of the indirect approach (Method 3) for \u0394volume (CV-R                             <sup>2</sup>                             =0.62), the direct approach (Method 2) (CV-R                             <sup>2</sup>                              = 0.66) has a higher accuracy. Within the volume estimation models, the \u0394 volume model (R                             <sup>2</sup>                              = 0.72) using the direct approach explains lower variability in the response variable than volume models in Time 1 and Time 2 (R                             <sup>2</sup>                              = 0.76-0.80). The canopy height distribution metrics of median height (i.e., h                             <sub>50</sub>                             ) and delta value of median height (\u0394h                             <sub>50</sub>                             ) were most often selected by the models. A small number of canopy return density metrics from the middle and upper canopy (i.e., d                             <sub>5</sub>                              and d                             <sub>7</sub>                             ) were selected for estimating volume in Time 1 and Time 2.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

To date, all work on MEMS scale multiferroic devices utilize linear multiferroic coupling. In this work, we present the first demonstration of frequency doubling through nonlinear multiferroics in MEMS resonators. Multiferroic composite cantilevers are fabricated and tested, and it is shown that these resonators can be wirelessly driven to mechanical resonance with magnetic fields at half of the resonant frequency by utilizing perpendicular magnetic poling. This is a potential method for low noise measurement of wireless signals, a problem that plagues all electrically-small wireless devices, which would revolutionize the emerging field of wireless multiferroic devices. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "With the abundance of spectral information and texture information of remote sensing images, the feature variables applicable to land cover classification also increase. But the high-dimensional features will deteriorate the classifier performance. In this paper, an improved selection method was proposed by considering separability and redundancy between feature variables. The study area - You County was divided into eight land cover types based on the SPOT-5 remote sensing image in 2009 combined with the continuous inventory data of forest resources during the same period. A total of 3,921 sample plots containing classification information were selected, of which 2/3 were used as training data, 1/3 as testing data. Waveband operations and texture extraction were performed on the images and a total of four bands information, eight texture factors, and nine vegetation indices were extracted as candidate feature variables subset. Calculate the weighted average of the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance between different classes of each feature variable, as the measure of class separability, and select the variable ordered first. Then calculate the PEARSON correlation coefficient between the remaining variables and the selected variables as the measure of variables redundancy. The ratio of separability and redundancy is referred to as the improved JM distance, which is successively substituted into the Bayesian classifier in descending order. The results show that (1) From the JM distance, the spectral features are more suitable for the land cover classification in the study area than the texture features. (2) The overall classification accuracy can be improved through the feature variables selected by improved JM distance. (3) The number of feature variables using the improved JM distance to achieve stable classification accuracy is far less than traditional JM distance, which effectively reduce feature dimensions. Therefore, the improved selection method proposed in this paper not only retains the class separability but also avoids the information redundancy, and can effectively select the feature variables. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this study, we assessed the performance of distributional and calibrated intensity metrics derived from the Unmanned Aerial System-Light Detection and Ranging (UAS-LiDAR) data to estimate total forest biomass individually and in combination over a ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba L.) planted forest in southeast China. First, the importance of these metrics were investigated and the optimal UAS- LiDAR metrics were selected by the \"all-subsets\" models. Then, the parametric (multivariate linear model (MLR)) and non-parametric (random forest (RF)) models were investigated for total forest biomass estimation. The results showed that, in general, the combo models (based on distributional and intensity metrics) (CV-R                             <sup>2</sup>                             =0.92-0.94, rRMSE=7.13%-7.62%) performed better than the separated models (CV-R                             <sup>2</sup>                             =0.90-0.92, rRMSE=8.05%-9.53%). Secondly, the estimation accuracy obtained from RF (CV-R                             <sup>2</sup>                             =0.92-0.94, rRMSE=7.13%-8.05%) was relatively higher than the MLR (CV-R                             <sup>2</sup>                             =0.88-0.90, rRMSE=7.62%-9.53%). This study demonstrated that compared with the MLR model, RF has stronger potential to enhance the performance of biomass estimation by using UAS-LiDAR- derived metrics, and the implementation of calibrated intensity metrics has shown marked contributions to total forest biomass estimation in planted forest.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The sensitivity of the amplitude ratio to input stiffness perturbations is experimentally determined for the two bifurcation points and compared to the sensitivity in a linear drive configuration. Similarly, the noise floor is measured at these operating points. It is observed that the input-referred noise floor is improved by approximately 2.5x by operating in the bottom-bifurcation point and by approximately 4x by operating at the top-bifurcation point in comparison to the linear drive configuration. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

To address the problem of information loss of the feature map in the process of pooling, the multi-scale fusion of the pooling layer and the deconvolutional layer is proposed. The activation function is also improved to extract more reliable features. Furthermore, to address the information loss problem in small buildings, multiple stacked denoising sparse auto-encoders are proposed. The experiment enhances the information of small target in the image and improves the input module of the fully convolutional network (FCN) model. Experimental results on aerial images of Wangdagua Village, Pingyuan County show that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods such as the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) and the artificial neural network (ANN). The results also show that the accuracy of the improved model is not only significantly higher than shallow machine learning methods, but also can be more effective in mining the law of high-resolution aerial images of small and medium-sized pieces of building space distribution and eliminate the false targets in the image up to a point. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Their single-bit output can be achieved by a Sigma Delta Modulator (SDM) which improves the noise shaping characteristics as well as the performance in terms of Signal-to-Noise-and-Distortion Ratio (SNDR). However, hardware implementation in FPGAs limits their overall performance due to undesired jitter effect introduced by the FPGA, which is translated into phase noise. In this work we present the hardware implementation of two all-digital frequency synthesizers based on SDMs which are afterwards corrected by a laboratory circuit for suppressing the jitter effect introduced by the clock reference of the FPGA. Comparison of the Quadrature Homodyne Filter (QHF) and Multiplier-Free QHF (MFQHF) SDM architectures in terms of digital synthesis results, SNDR, sampling rate and jitter-free spectrums are provided to demonstrate their capabilities in order to consider them as viable choice for digital frequency synthesis. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

LBP is a local based descriptor while the DTMs is a global based descriptor seem to makes the combination difficult, however, we managed in this paper to propose an interesting approach that takes advantage of their pros while imitating their cons and outperform their weaknesses.

        "abstract": "High spatial resolution remote sensing image has a wealth of information about ground objects, and the characteristics of objects such as shape, spectrum, texture etc. are richer than medium and low resolution images. Object oriented image analysis is the main stream method in high spatial remote sensing image analysis. Segmentation is the basis of image classification. The traditional image segmentation method uses the same set of parameters for the entire image. However, due to objects' scale-dependent nature, the optimal segmentation parameters for an overall image may not be suitable for every objects, it just a compromise of all objects. According to idea of spatial dependence, the similar objects which have the similar spatial scale often gathered in same regions and dominated in that area, such as city region contains many kinds of objects, may has a small inherent scale, while countryside region has simple ground distribution pattern can use a small scale to segment. So, putting regional image which was divided by overall image as processing image, the over-segmentation and under-segmentation problems will be released. Based above, this paper proposes a scene division based stratified object oriented image analysis method. Since image's hue information can quantify color information, and make the similar color have similar hue value. So, image's hue information has become the mainly basis of scene division, and in order to use this information effectively, second order matrix was used to reflect the relationship of hue values. Second order matrix can reflect image's visual complexity, so it can used to divide the overall image into simple and complex objects occupied scenes. What's more the complex objects occupied scenes can be re-divided into several scenes of which the composition is simple or single. In order to set segmentation parameters accurately and quickly, spatial estimation method was used to calculate every scene image's scale parameter, thus optimal scale can be selected for every scene. Since the complexity of data is effectively reduced by dividing the overall image into several scenes, and spatial estimation method can help select optimal segmentation parameters, so the final classification result can be improved efficiently, and the experiment result also proved the effectiveness of the proposed method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) remote sensing system has advantages in flexibility, economy, high efficiency and real time monitoring. In this paper, 10 visible light vegetation indices based on UAV image were calculated and compared in their performance in extracting vegetation information. After the indices calculation, 15 same-sized AOI regions were selected for each of the six types of land objects (including vegetation-grassland, forest land, crops and non-vegetation-buildings, roads, and bare land) for further analysis of the performance of different vegetation indices. Bimodal histogram and the histogram entropy threshold method were used to determine the threshold value of each vegetation index for extracting vegetation information. Then, accuracy and efficiency were compared for different indices. Finally, RGBDI was chosen extract the vegetation from the UAV image owing to its extraction accuracy and efficiency. The results showed that RGBDI extraction accuracy was as highly as 99% and threshold value was easily determined by using bimodal histogram threshold method. The accuracy of VDVI and EXG were lower than RGBDI, VDVI has the accuracy of 97% and the EXG has 90%. Their threshold value can also be easily determined by histogram entropy method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

An efficient and accurate method of generating landslide susceptibility maps is very important to mitigate the loss of lives and properties caused by these landslides. In this paper, a deep belief network (DBN) with datasets developed via a geographic information system (GIS) and remotely sensed data was used to create a landslide spatial susceptibility map for the TGR region on the Yangtze River in Zigui County. The landslide inventory map was initially constructed using field surveys, aerial photographs, and a literature search of historical landslide records. The twelve causative factors were evaluated in different ways: elevation, topographic slope, topographic aspect, curvature, distance from drainage, distance from road, schedule performance index and topographic wetness index were derived from a digital topographical map at 1:10,000 scale; engineering petrofabric, slope structure and distance from faults were obtained from a geological map at 1: 50,000 scale; normalized difference vegetation index were generated from CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite) data. All the causative factors were resampled to a grid cell size of 10 \u2217 10 m by using the grid analysis function of ArcGIS software. Initially, 30% of the landslides pixels and equal number of non-landslides pixels were randomly selected as training data. Then these twelve factors were used as the input to DBN. By integrating the twelve factor maps in the GIS via pixel-based computing, the landslide spatial susceptibility map was obtained. Then the study area was reclassified into four categories of landslide susceptibility: high, moderate, low, and very low by using natural breaks classification methods. Approximately 13.6% of the study area was identified as severe susceptibility, and moderate, low, very low susceptibility zones covered 1.3%, 1.4%, and 83.7% of the study area, respectively. To show the performance of the DBN, the results were then compared with a logistic regression model (LRM) by using the receiver operating characteristics (ROC). The area under the ROC curve was 0.949 for the DBN and 0.859 for the LRM. The results showed that, the DBN proposed in this study outperforms the LSM. Based on the efficiency and accuracy of DBN, the proposed approach can be employed for rapid response to natural hazards in the Three Gorges area. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Airborne vector geomagnetic measurement can not only obtain total geomagnetic field strength of geomagnetic field, but also detect the vector information of geomagnetic field, so it is an effective technology to obtain the geomagnetic field information of land and offing area in high precision and resolution quickly. Therefore, this technology has broad application prospect in the domain of aviation, sailing, and spaceflight, especially in the application of self-navigation of geomagnetic matching. The first airborne vector geomagnetic measurement was successfully developed by Xi'an research institute of surveying and mapping and national space science center of Chinese academy of sciences in China. During May-June in 2015, and June-July in 2016, the integration experimentation of the airborne vector geomagnetic measurement was organized by Xi'an Research Institute of Surveying and Mapping on the plain of Inner Mongolia, it included 227 flying surveying lines, and of which the length was about 5000 kilometers, so a great amount of total geomagnetic field strength and vector information of geomagnetic field were obtained. Based on 15 repeated flying surveying lines, 400 crossing points of 20 intersection flying surveying lines in the direction of south-north, east-west, which are in 200m and 700m flying height, the precision evaluation of the airborne vector geomagnetic measurement is accomplished by the comparison of repeated flying surveying lines and crossing points. From the comparison of repeated flying surveying lines, we can get the conclusion that the precision of total geomagnetic field strength on the flying surveying lines in 200m and 700m flying height are 2nT and 1nT, respectively. The precision of three components of the geomagnetic field are between 5nT and 10nT. And from the comparison of crossing points, we can get the conclusion that the precision of total geomagnetic field strength on the flying surveying lines are 1nT, the precision of three components of the geomagnetic field are below 10nT. Therefore, from the data processing of the first airborne vector geomagnetic measurement in China, we can see that the precision of total geomagnetic field strength is about 2nT, and the precision of three components of the geomagnetic field are about 10nT. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The approach uses modal analysis to quickly solve for displacements at anchor points, a proxy for energy radiated out of the resonator. Results are compared to experimental data, explaining variations in quality factor from 100 to 2000 based on aspect ratio. Specific aspect ratios which mitigate anchor loss were found to occur for different material stacks, in this case a width to length ratio of 1.4 exhibits a peak in quality factor, in addition to increased coupling compared to extremely low width to length ratios. Flexure due to stack asymmetry limits this effect at higher harmonics. Methods to reduce anchor loss through tethering and acoustic reflectors can be used in parallel with this work to further reduce anchor loss. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, owing to the low number of samples and strong relativity between different bands, its always tough to get a precise classification result. In this paper, 3D-Gabor-based feature selection algorithm name 3DG-EFDPC is proposed to address this problem. 3D Gabor filter can preserve intrinsic information of hyperspectral image and extract distinguished features with joint spatial/spectral domains for increasing accuracy of classification, via capturing different orientation, scale, and wavelength properties of hyperspectral image data. However, a feature selection process must be taken due to redundance might exist in 3D Gabor feature. For this purpose, we introduce enhanced fast density-peak-based clustering(EFDPC) algorithm. Through calculating the normalized local density and the intracluster distance of each feature, EFDPC regard features which both values are anomalously large as cluster center which contain discriminative and valuable information. Furthermore, in order to confirm the number of chosen features decided by the cutoff threshold, the EFDPC algorithm propose an exponential-based learning rule. We demonstrate the performance of the 3DG-EFDPC features for classification on real hyperspectral remote sensing data sets. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "VPN (Virtual Private Network) is often the most efficient and the least expensive way to maintain flexibility, integrity and confidentiality of data exchange over the Internet. It also enables users to establish private and secure connections and avoid the common geographical restrictions of certain services offered on the net. In this context, the Deep Packet Inspection techniques (DPIs) enable firewalls to filter the VPN traffic when it is not encrypted. Otherwise, it becomes difficult to do so. In this paper, we propose a method for characterizing the traffic in one step i.e., without previously dividing VPN from non-VPN. Instead, we combine over- and under-sampling followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This approach allows selecting the optimum feature subset before performing an efficient traffic classification using Support Vectors Machines classifier. In order to assess our findings, 14 types of traffic were used: 7 encrypted and 7 VPN traffic categories. Accordingly, we used only time-based flow-based features. We checked the effectiveness and performances of our proposal through several experiments of different generated timeout flows of durations on the UNB ISCX data set. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Their use is continuing to be increased, and this in many areas like health, environment, battlefield etc. However, the limited resources of the sensor nodes is a real constraint, mainly in terms of energy autonomy. For this reason, one of the big challenges in deploying such a kind of networks is developing an energy-aware routing protocols to prolong the network lifespan. Clustering is among techniques widely used to exploit the energy of the network efficiently. Though, it is pointed out in the literature that designing a clustering algorithm is an NP-hard problem. Recently, many meta-heuristic approaches had been proposed for this purpose. Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) is a recent bio-inspired optimization algorithm. This paper discusses an Enhanced Cuckoo Search-based (ECSBCP) as a routing protocol for WSN. The obtained results reveal that our proposed routing scheme is less energy consuming, extend the network lifespan and data sent to the Base Station (BS) are increased, compared to the well-known LEACH. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The Loess covered areas include Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu and other provinces and is the main coal production base. The Loess Plateau is characterized by varied topography, complicated geological and geomorphic conditions and large thickness of mining coal seam, which results in many types of geological hazards, wide distribution and great threat. Therefore, it is very necessary to monitor the surface deformation by full coverage and all-weather monitoring. The vertical deformation information with high accuracy can be obtained by using D-InSAR technology. Compared with the traditional monitoring method, it has the advantages of high resolution, high coverage, all-weather measurement and low cost. With the continuous development of this technology, the surface subsidence monitoring technology of D-InSAR is gradually introduced to the ground subsidence monitoring of the coal mine area. However, due to the complex and varied landform in loess area, the monitoring difficulty of D-InSAR technology has increased a lot. It also makes the monitoring of conventional methods more difficult. Sentinel-1 satellite has been applied in October 2014. Sentinel data become a data source of SAR image. Sentinel data also become data support of D-InSAR technology, and can effectively monitor deformation. In this paper, the processing steps of D-InSAR technology and the problems existing in each step are briefly described and the technical flow chart is drawn. 4 consecutive pairs of interference pairs in the time of the bingchang mining area were treated with D-InSAR, and the mining area deformation maps of 4 continuous periods were obtained. Through the superposition of 4 deformation maps one by one, the gradual process of the mining area and the settlement of the mining area is obtained and analyzed. The measured subsidence data and the processed subsidence data are compared and analyzed, and the cross section map of the working face line and the longitudinal line is drawn. The results show that: Sentinel-1 satellite data can perform differential interference processing well and carry out large area continuous monitoring, and also can well reflect the subsidence trend of mining area, and suitable for small deformation monitoring in mining area. However, the vegetation has a greater impact on the D-InSAR processing results of the sentinel-1 satellite data. The higher the vegetation coverage, the worse the coherence of the interference pairs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Since the images obtained from the videos are very similar, the main assumption of this study is that the whole video can be represented by fewer images. The approach used in this study is the structural similarity index. Totally, images were obtained from 4 different videos coming from healthy, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's, and polyp patients. The noisy images in these videos were eliminated manually. When the structural similarity index between two consecutive clear images was less than 0.83, the second image was selected and shown to the specialist for his/her examination. By this way, the frames carrying significantly new information from the videos were defined as the variation instances. The tests on healthy or diseased colon videos showed that only 5-10% of the clear images provide significantly new information. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "                             Rapid increase in antibiotic resistance and the inadequacy of other antibacterial treatments are serious risk factors for human and animal health worldwide. Researchers have begun to focus on photodynamic therapy (PDT) as an alternative treatment. This treatment is based on the killing of pathogens by the formation of toxic products after the interaction of light with light-sensitive drugs (photosensitizer) and oxygen. It is also important to emphasize how antibacterial photodynamic therapy affects healthy cells which play an important role in wound healing process. In this regard, the previously proven antibacterial effect of indocyanine green and 808-nm on healthy human keratinocyte cells was investigated in this study. The main objective of this research is to determine the concentrations of indocyanine green and the energy dose of laser light which are destructive to certain pathogens and not harmful to healthykeratinocytes. According to the results of this study, PDT applications using ICG at 4-125 \u03bcg/ml concentrations and 84 J/cm                             <sup>2</sup>                              energy dose did not damage keratinocyte cells significantly. The concentration of 150 \u03bcg/ml ICG killed the cells in all applications. Application of 252 J / cm                             <sup>2</sup>                              energy dose damaged keratinocyte cells with all ICG concentrations.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Burns, trauma, cancer, etc., which deteriorate the integrity of the skin. Skin expansion surgeries that are used for therapeutic purposes with natural inspiration in cases are usually inflated with a saline infusion of a silicone balloon placed under the skin. Although imitating nature is the most challenging part of this treatment, knowing whether there is a physiological limit or not is the answer that will produce physical activity on the ground. In other words, when the physical force is above a certain value, the balloon is inflated excessively, resulting in complications such as necrosis due to impaired perfusion when the pressure effect applied to the ball by the pulling forces and balloon is over, or balloon exposition due to deep tearing at higher levels. For this reason, its deep physical properties and knowledge of the changes during application will give a very valuable insight into whether a pathological effect will occur. Optical, electrical and tensile responses will emerge in response to the physical changes that can occur in the bubble as the balloon is inflated. While many versions of these three responses are the subject of many studies separately in the literature, the biggest obstacle to the simultaneous execution of the researches is undoubtedly the low cost and high cost of synchronous devices. The topic of this article is the design of an effective system that can be used for research in this sense and the validity of the tests made. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A small working group of 20 healthy subjects are asked to play a fruit- assisted rehabilitation system with the use of these two adaptive methods. The difficulty of the game is dynamically changed according to the performances (score) of the subjects with these two algorithms.

All EEG segments are mapped into a corresponding graph to obtain the corresponding degree of sequence for each segment, and then the difference between these degrees is constructed as a similarity between two segments. The results showed that seizure activity presented strongest nonlinear dynamic response in the form of similarity level decreasing from healthy subjects to patients.

If the measurement time to be allocated for each item of medical device is known, the time of the total metrology service can be calculated. So that the cost of the service can be calculated in more acceptable dimensions. For this reason, it is important for health care providers to plan their measurement schedules and costs by taking into consideration the measurement time factor. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In the proposed method, first, a total variation method, which includes both the smoothing term and the fidelity term, is considered to eliminate speckle noise from the given image. Then, gradient values of the image are computed in the horizontal and vertical directions. These generated images are set to three color channels in the red, green and blue color space. In this study, the smoothed given image, gradient values in the horizontal direction and gradient values in the vertical direction are set to the red color channel, the green color channel and the blue color channel respectively. Thus, the structure and texture information of the given image are able to be colorized without excessive degradation. In other words, in the proposed method, the images, which are created via the ultrasound medical imaging modality, are artificially successfully colorized. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The ability to transmit ultrasonic power in a single direction strongly depends on the rigid structure of the backing materials used in ultrasonic transducers. For this reason, it has been tried to be investigated the hardness of the backing materials used in ultrasonic transducers by mixing the epoxy materials at different ratios both in volume and by weight. Our goal here is to reach the correct mixture ratios by evaluating the hardness values of epoxy mixtures in different ratios. Hardness measurements were made on the Shore A scale. In the study, the hardnesses of the mixtures prepared in seven different ratios were examined, and in the second part of the study, the hardnesses of the four different mixtures prepared as weight on the basis of the results of the volumetric ratios were investigated. In the last part of the study, tungsten powder, which is used to increase the density of the epoxy material and thus provide better acoustic impedance, was added in different weights to the epoxy material that consisted of adhesive and hardener components and so the final hardness ratios were tried to be determined. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Reactive loads existing in the electrical model of PZT vary depending on frequency that is one of the parameters of alternative power. The electrical impedance matching with the alternative power supply has to be carried out in order to ensure that the produced treatment probes by using PZTs work effectively. Thus, the power applied from the source will be consume on the probe and the effective dose and treatment will be provided. In this study, electrical matching of the probe having a rectangular geometry produced from PZT and operating a central frequency of 1 MHZ which is used in the medical field is presented.

Another goal of this study is to demonstrate that the infrared transceiver array can measure optical changes due to different solvents and different glucose concentrations. The data are obtained and compared based on the concentration of glucose in each solution and solution. The closed system we use for this study is completely isolated from the outside environment and the 950nm infrared receiver - transmitter installed with arduino is prevented from being influenced by different light sources. In our study, water, isopropyl alcohol and glycerol were used as solvent for glucose determination. Our receiver-transmitter is the most commonly used infrared transceiver in the 950-nm wavelength range. The data received from the receiver was converted to volt value with Arduino software and significant values were created. As a result of the measurements, it was observed that the voltage value changed due to the concentration of the solution. As the glucose concentration in the solution increased, the voltage value decreased. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In last two decades, blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI has become an important neuroscientific tool because of ability to image brain function. In this current study, we examined functional connectivity within various visual networks occuring at resting state in children with and without ADHD. It is performed by independent component analysis within group analysis. We found four independent components (ICs) which are included of visual networks. Significant differences were obtained in activation regions of visual networks.

To this end, a 6\u00d76 speller BCI was designed using a monit\u00f6r with a refresh rate up to 240 Hz. Six subjects participated in three dierent experiments with refresh rates of 60 Hz (E1), 120 Hz (E2) and 240 Hz (E3), where a 127-bit m-sequence is used. Information transfer rate (ITR) and accuracy values were calculated for each experiment and subject. Power spectral density (PSD) estimates of c-VEP responses and results of principal component analysis (PCA) were evaluated. Average ITR and accuracy values for E1 are 84.24 bits/min and 91%, for E2 are 90.68 bits/min and 95% and for E3 72.16 bits/min and 82% respectively. Also 5 out of 6 subjects stated that E3, and 1 subject stated that E2 is the most comfortable experiment. The c-VEP responses are band-limited although the input m-sequence is a wide-band signal. The spectral densities of c-VEP templates are concentrated on several frequency intervals, especially for E3. This periodicity leads to target misclassification. PCA shows that only 73, 52, and 26 well distinguishable responses can be obtained with a 127-bit length m-sequence for E1, E2, and E3 respectively. Considering all results and observations, we suggest that 120 Hz refresh rate is best to use in BCIs with high number of targets whereas 240 Hz refresh rate is reasonable for low number of targets. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The emotion recognition from EEG signals is a difficult study by the reason of nonstationary behavior of the signals. These signals are affected from complicated neural activity of brain. To analyze EEG signals, advanced signal processing techniques are required. In our study, data are collected from one channeled BIOPAC lab system. EEG signals were obtained from visual evoked potentials of 13 female and 13 male volunteers for 12 pleasant and 12 unpleasant pictures. To analyze nonlinear and nonstationary characteristics of EEG signals, an EMD-based method is proposed for emotion recognition. Various time and frequency domain techniques such as power spectral density (PSD), and higher order statistics (HOS) are used to analyze the IMFs extracted by EMD. Support vector machine (SVM), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and Naive Bayes classifiers are utilized for the classification of features extracted from the IMFs, and their performances are compared. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Metallic biomaterials have high fracture toughness and tensile strength compared to other implant materials such as ceramics and polymers. Accordingly, metallic implants are widely used in orthopedic. Titanium (Ti) is a frequently preferred biomaterial due to the properties such as resistance to corrosion, non-toxicity to the human body and mechanical strength. However, when Ti implants cannot be sufficiently osteo-integrated in the host bone, bone tissue formation fails and limits the use of these implants. Today, Ti surfaces can potentially be functionalized to provide useful additional features such as overcome above corrosion resistance, increasing bioactivity and osteo-integration properties. The ability of cells to attach to Ti implants and secrete extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules improve new functional tissue formation. Integrins which present in the cell structure, play an active role in cell adhesion and interact with short amino acid sequences in extracellular matrix molecules. Especially, the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence, has been described as mediating cells of various plasma and ECM proteins, including fibronectin, vitronectin, type 1 collagen, osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. Bioactive peptide constructs that are conjugated to the surface of implants have the potential to increase implant cell interaction, inhibit fibrous tissue formation, and provide direct osteointegration of the implant. The most effective way of achieving peptide conjugation to the implant surface, which is an important step at this point, can be considered as a parameter directly affecting osteointegration. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of commonly used Ti-peptide conjugation methods on cell attachment and proliferation. Moreover, competitive conjugation success was interpreted by fluorescence imaging technique, contact angle measurement and AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy). \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Measurements and documentation of the vital signs carried out by nurses at hospitals. In this study, the methods used in vital signs measurements of hospitalized patients were evaluated by observations and interviews at a foundation university hospital and the advantages and disadvantages of the existing technologies were determined. As a result of interviews with healthcare providers and observations, it was determined that vital signs measurements of hospitalized patients were performed by 2 different methods. The mean time of vital signs measurements were determined as 3 minutes and 4 seconds (SD: 00:31) in medical treatment patients, 2 minutes and 11 seconds (SD: 00:18) in surgical patients, and 2 minutes and 37 seconds (SD: 00:37) in all patients. It was determined that the measurement results were recorded in the patient physical file in an average of 1 minute 2 seconds (SD: 00:52) and it was revealed that 15% of the measurement records were wrong, 26.9% were delayed and 10.6% were not recorded which performed by the nurses. It was also determined that the measurement results were not included in the hospital information system. It is thought that vital findings will provide important data for artificial intelligence studies in the following period with the recording of the results of the measurement to the electronic environment. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Perception is influenced by emotional experiences, attitudes, goals, ambience and nudity. Detection patterns; sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell, space and time perception. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effect of external stimuli on human sensation using EMOTIV EPOC + device which is an EEG (Electroencephalography) based device. EMOTIV EPOC is a 14 channel wireless EEG device designed for research and advanced brain computer interface (BCI) applications. The device simultaneously measures connection, excitement, attention, interest, relaxation and stress emotions with the Xavier interface program. In the data collection process, Stroop test proving that visual perception as an external stimulus precedes symbolic- semantic perception, and binaural sound directing brain signals were used. Based on the Stroop effect, a 5-stage game with Unity 3D was developed. In the developed game, 15 healthy 15 girls and 15 boys aged between 20 and 25 were collected for a total of 30 subjects for 6 different emotional states. Post-Hoc test was applied to collected data using SPSS program. As a result of the analysis of the data, it was seen that external stimuli had an effect on human perception. Affecting emotional situations has been seen to be the most attention, link building, stress, excitement, attention and relaxation respectively. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It is necessary to emphasize, the plasma technique using on directly liver cell for the treatment is the novel study. The examples of portable commercial devices in the world have started to increase in the recent past, but they are still few. The project has three main design in general; primarily high voltage power supply, bipolar plasma probe, gas supply control unit made it. High voltage power supply made with transformator and mosfets connecting with push-pull. Bipolar plasma probe, made 2 tungsten rod which mounted on the board mechanism and used teflon wire for connection with high voltage power supply. For the gas supply control unit, used microprocessor controlled and transistor amplifier selenoid valve. Thus, it is aimed to trigger the solenoid valve and adjust the gas flow in the adjustable frequency range. In the first tests made, the formation of radiation of the high voltage circuit was observed. The integration with the tungsten probe system was completed and tried to test the relation between angle and distance and radiation. In addition, the completed parts of the gas supply control unit designed together with the solenoid valve and the microprocessor have been tested. etc. in its style sheet. As a result, the distance parameter of radiation formation is determined by high voltage circuit tests. Radiation-angle tests were performed and later turned into a prototype with the outer design of the device. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

For example, according to a nationwide survey conducted by Science, Industry and Technology Ministry, General Directorate of Metrology and Standardizing, calibration of the phantoms that are used both in operator training and quality control of the ultrasound devices can not be done in Turkey. However, TUBITAK UME Medical Metrology Laboratory can now perform Ultrasound Phantom Proficiency Tests in the UME. Ultrasound phantoms have a critical condition for both quality control of ultrasound devices and user training, and there are thousands of ultrasonic devices in our country. The fact that Ultrason Phantom Qualification Tests are performed in our country is a significant performance indicator in the system inspections of calibration laboratories (ISO 9001, ISO 17025). In this study, the proficiency test of ultrasonic imaging device in our laboratory was tested with seven different operators using CIRS brand ultrasonic imaging phantom. Based on the tolerances given in the standards according to the Z number (score) test, all operators have passed the test successfully. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, in recent years neuropsychological studies have focused on the relationship between IQ and brain waves. In particular, many studies have investigated the relationship between Evoked Potential signals and IQ results. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the P300 signal, one of the Auditory Evoked Potential signals, and the IQ test results. Within the scope of the project, the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) test was used to measure participants' IQ levels. In addition, to obtain the P300 signal, the Oddball Auditory Stimulus Model participant was applied by Electroencephalography (EEG) device. Signals are received by the MP150 system and the P300 signal is provided by the MATLAB Signal Processing module. Biostatistical analysis was performed with the data associated. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This system is comprised of four main components that we have designed and developed: Mobile application software 'patient assistant mod\u00fcle (PAM)' running on Android and IOS mobile device, 'Measurement Station (MESTA)' Windows store software running on touchscreen PC, and 'Server and Monitoring System (SEMS' running on a server that is located at the hospital and works in interaction with other hospital information systems, and 'Wearable Patient Monitoring Module (WPMM)'. As an application study of ALTHIS, we consider monitoring of glucose measurements of diabetic patients.

This study describes the use of image processing and deep learning to diagnose diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images. For retinal fundus images enhancement approach, a practical method which contains HSV, V transform algorithm and histogram equalization technics was used. Finally, Gaussian low-pass filter was applied to the retinal fundus image. After the image processing, the classification was made using the Convolutional Neural Network. The performance of the proposed method was assessed using 400 retinal fundus images in the Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection database. In experiments, classification work has been done for each stage of the image processing. The classification study performed after image processing. Twenty experiments were done for every stage and average values were found. In this experiment, the accuracy was 96.67%, the sensitivity was 93.33%, the specificity was 93.33%, the precision was 93.33%, the recall was 93.33%, and the F-score was 93.33%. The obtained results show that the proposed method is very efficient and successful to diagnose diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Despite advances in screening for early diagnosis, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths. Drug is used in the early stage of cancer and patient follow-up is performed. Photochemical reactions begin by the accumulation of photosensitizers in the cancerous tissue when induced by light stimulation. As a result of these reactions, cancer cells become apoptosis. There are no side effects as in other cancer treatments. Photdynamic theray has the advantage of being able to select cancerous cell without harming other tissues. In this study, the effects of methylene blue on HT-29 colon cancer cells were investigated. At the end of the study, control group and treatment group were compared.

The pH must be precisely adjusted to improve the coating quality. At the same time, in order to be able to make a precise measurement, systems which are real time, fast and not affected from the environment are needed. In this study, Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) sensor was used to determine and analyze the best coating method based on MPS. The sensor surface was coated in two different ways: Coating-I and Coating-II. Coating-I is solely based on MPS and the surface was coated with acidic and basic solutions of MPS, respectively. In Coating-II, the surface was modified with MPS firstly and then 2-Mercaptoethanol (ME) solutions. The surface modification was controlled with introducing Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) suspension to the system. While inverse frequency shift was observed in Coating-I and surface coating did not occur, in Coating-II an average 200 Hz frequency shift was observed at each step and the surface was coated. This surface coating provides a real-time, fast and convenient surface chemistry for sensors of interest. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The aim of the study is to develop a device that synthesizes carbon nanoparticles by dense medium plasma method; together with hardware, software and mechanical design. Dense medium plasma is an easy synthesis approach with low cost; However, it is necessary for the user of this device to be more comfortable to use, feasible, portable and suitable for market. Moreover there is no commercial device for synthesing carbon nanoparticles by dense medium plasma technique. This research presents details of construction of affordable device for carbon nanoparticle sythesis. Prototype is an unique doimestic product and contains integrated hardware, software and mechanical probe parts. Hardware part consists of control, power unit and induction coil unit and these three units are connected to each other. The power unit ensures that the mosfets are triggered by a certain voltage from the control unit. The induction coil unit is induced by turning the low voltage to high voltage. In the mechanical part, probe design supplies discharge betweeen electodes which are fed by argon gase that converts benzene to the carbon nanoparticles. The probe reaches the resonance frequency and to make it easier to adjust the distance between the bottom and top electrode, a spindle system is used. Software operation is measuring high voltage. To make the appliance portable, moreover wheeled table production was done. As a result, signal and power card tests were made, it was observed that the high voltage circuit, the signal circuit and the induction coil cause radiation. More nanoparticle production was achieved with the controllable distance between the bottom electrode and the top electrode of probe. The efficiency of the synthesis was improved and the usage of the device was made practical. Finally prototype device that is usable for synthesis nanoparticles by dense medium technology is constructed affordablity and presented with all details. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

These strains have gained antibiotic resistance over time due to misuse of antibiotics. Since bactericide resistance to antibiotics makes treatment difficult, this has led to the research for new treatment methods. One of these new methods is Photodynamic Therapy (PDT). PDT is photoinactivation of microorganisms by reactive oxygen species that are produced by a light-activated and light-sensitive substance with a light source at certain wavelength. In this study, 655 nm laser light source with diode pump working at maximum 2 Watt power and chlorine e6 (Ce6) at different doses were used as light sensitive substance. The aim of this study was to increase the effect of antibacterial photodynamic therapy on resistant gram-negative bacteria by using Potassium Iodide (KI) salt synergistically. This application resulted in quite effective mortality rates on antibiotic resistant P. aeruginosa strain. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a psychiatric condition that affects millions of children and many times last into adulthood. There is no single test that can show whether a person has ADHD. The symptoms vary from person to person. Therefore, it is hard to diagnose ADHD contrary to many physical illnesses. Our aim is to create methods to minimize human effort and increase accuracy of diagnosis of ADHD. We collected structural Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) from 26 subjects: 11 controls and 15 children diagnosed with ADHD. The data was provided from NPIstanbul NeuroPsychiatric Hospital. We developed automatic, effective, rapid, and accurate framework for diagnosing ADHD. The models were built on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) and naive Bayes using Matlab machine learning toolbox. Shape and texture feature extraction technique was used. Area, Perimeter, Eccentricity, EquivDiameter, Major Axis Length, Minor Axis Length, Orientation are characteristics used for shape feature extraction technique. Textural features of a magnetic resonance imaging were represented with first (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) and second order statistical (contrast, correlation, homogeneity, energy) based feature extraction techniques. Gray and white regions were extracted using k-means algorithms. Local features were extracted from these regions by shape and texture methods. Global features were extracted with second order statistics which is called gray level co-occurrence method. The most important attribute was determined by using principal component analysis. The experiments were conducted on a full training dataset including 26 instance and 5 fold cross validation was adopted for randomly sampling training and test sets. ADHD is successfully classified with 100 % accuracy by using the proposed method. The outcome of our study will reduce the number medical errors by informing physicians in their efforts of diagnosing ADHD. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The purpose of this study is to develop a method which will ensure the MUNE by the analysis of the data obtained via electrohysiological muscle scan. CMAPs which were generetaed as a result of gradual stimulation in simulator software were recorded. The absolute values of the differences of CMAPs and the ratio of the mean of these values to the maximum CMAP value were computed through a software created in MATLAB to calculate MUNE values. Hence, it was intended to determine the relationship between the real axon count and MUNE. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The main purpose of classification studies is to increase the classification performance and increase the diagnostic rate. Different classification methods and different optimization algorithms are used for this. In this context, in this study, a classification study with Autoencoder deep neural networks was performed for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The Pima Indian diabetes dataset in the UCI machine learning laboratory, which is widely used in the classification study, was used. The results of the study were compared with the results of previous which focuses on the diagnosis of diabetes studies using the same UCI machine learning dataset. The obtained classification accuracy is 97.3% and higher than the previously mentioned classification methods. The obtained evaluations show that the proposed method is very efficient and increases the classification success. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

An open issue in emotional modeling is to obtain an optimum feature set to use for the classification process. This study proposes an approach for emotional state classification by the investigation of EEG signals via multivariate synchrosqueezing transform (MSST). MSST is a post-processing technique to compose a localized time-frequency representation yielding multivariate syncyrosqueezing coefficients. After obtaining these coefficients from EEG signals for 18 subjects from DEAP dataset, coefficients and self-assessment-mannequins (SAM) labels of those subjects are used for emotional state classification by using support vector machines (SVM) nearest neighbor, decision tree, and ensemble methods. The accuracy rate is 70.6% for high valence high arousal (HVHA), 75.4% for low valence high arousal (LVHA), 77.8% for high valence low arousal (HVLA), and 77.2% for low valence low arousal (LVLA) cases using SVM. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Segmentation of the MR images in clinical researches and in clinical engineering-based studies is emerging as a considerable requirement for the analysis of the disease images and the diseases. Medical software tools have been developed to meet this need and to provide facilities for the clinicians, surgeons and researchers in computer-aided research projects they conduct. Currently available MR image segmentation tools have many differences when considering criteria such as design, graphical-user interface and functions they provide.

Primarily, Hilbert Transform-based empirical mode decomposition (EMD) was found to be suitable for emotional state modeling studies. In more recent studies, models of emotional state recognition were proposed in which the classification was implemented by using the features obtained after applying the time, frequency, and time-frequency domain methods to intrinsic mode functions achieved by operating EMD. In this study, an analysis of emotional state recognition is proposed by using the features of the synchrosqueezing coefficients obtained in the classification process after applying the Synchrosqueezing Transform to intrinsic mode functions achieved by using Multivariate EMD. As a result, EEG data available in the DEAP database were categorized as low and high for valence, activation, and dominance dimensions, and 4 different classifiers were utilized in the classification process. The most satisfying ratios of valence, activation and dominance were attained 76%, 68%, and 68% respectively. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Sleep apnea is a very common respiratory disorder in the community that includes a range from upper airway obstruction to respiratory abnormalities and the absence of a breathing effort, which can lower people's standard of living and even cause death. Therefore, the sleep apnea needs to be diagnosed in a practical way and with high accuracy. The diagnosis of apnea is made by recording the physiological parameters of the patient with polysomnography (PSG) method and by examination of these parameters by specialist physicians, but it is a tedious and time consuming process. In order to simplify the apnea diagnosis process, phospletismography (PPG) signals are used instead of PSG records. PPG signals are suitable for diagnosis of apnea because they reflect changes in respiration. In the proposed study, a decision support system was developed to automatically diagnose apnea and to make apnea diagnosis easier and more objective using PPG signals. In the decision support system, the peaks of the PPG signal were determined and the heart rate variability (HRV) vector was generated depending on the time difference between these peaks. The mean and standard deviation values of the generated vector are determined as features for each epoch. The presence of the apnea at each epoch is classified using \"Subspace K Nearest Neighbor (Subspace KNN)\" and specified features. The \"Subspace KNN\" classifier was trained with 85% accuracy and then system was tested. As a result, sensitivity, accuracy and specificity rates were calculated as 91%, 95% and 90% respectively. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

For this purpose, in this study, a one-dimensional signal processing toolbox has been designed using the MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI). Real-time medical signals can be obtained and analyzed in time and frequency domains. This toolbox can be used to analyze a signal that is pre-recorded or one dimensional that is created by a user. Due to the toolbox developed, the data which are acquired from EMG and ECG cards and digitized in the Arduino microprocessor are displayed in real time on the computer screen. Also, the high-frequency noises in the ECG signal have been eliminated by designing a Parks-McClellan low pass FIR filter. Heart rate has been calculated with high accuracy by counting R peak points per minute from the noise reduced ECG signal automatically. By using the developed signal processing toolbox, any kind of general or medical signals can be analyzed in more detail and fast. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this study, the effect of blood viscosity on the pressure and wall shear stress that form on the walls of an artery with a 70% reduced cross-sectional area was investigated using computational fluid dynamics.

It has been shown that these parameters increase linearly with increasing blood viscosity in a normal artery and behave nonlinearly along the different regions of an artery with stenosis. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions can be achieved in 3D cell culture systems as in vivo systems. For this reason, the loss of cell functions is less in 3D cultures than in two dimensional systems. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) which are model cell types, are frequently used because of easily isolation and using vasculogenesis research in 3D culture. The isoleucine-Iysine-valine-alanine-valine (Ile-Lys- Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV)) sequence, one of the most effective units of laminin, is used as a support material in the ECM. IKVAV peptides can affect many cellular functions such as adhesion, proliferation, migration, metastasis, and are used in cell culture systems. The effects of IKVAV peptide on HUVEC microtissues were examined in this study. Increase in diameter was observed in microtissues incubated with concentrations of 0.5 and 1 mM peptides. Also when comparison of microtissues with and without peptide concentrations, has been shown to the IKVAV peptide increase cell viability. Compared with 0.5 and 1 mM, higher cell viability and diameter values are observed at 1 mM peptide concentration. This information supports the results of monolayer studies in the literature. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Since many strains can easily become resistant to many antibiotics, various treatment mechanisms against MRSA infections have begun to be developed. Various disinfectants, detergents, organic solvents and chemicals have been tried to create synergistic effects either by themselves or by combining them with innovative methods. In this study, photodynamic therapy on MRSA strains and adjuvant effect of ethanol were assessed. In photodynamic therapy applications, 655-nm laser light and chlorine e6 dissolved in ethanol were used. Using ethanol as an adjuvant therapy increased activity of Clorine e6 with quite low dose of light energy and photosensitizer concentration resulting in sufficient antibacterial effect. The energy dose of light and the concentration of the photosensitizer were reduced substantially so that healthy cells would not be damaged in in vivo or clinical studies. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

We investigated whether we can predict who will respond more to neurofeedback applied by AutoTrainBrain by analyzing the resting state EEG brain data. Based on our analysis of the EEG data collected, we observed that the power amplitudes across resting states in the theta band over the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) (electrode: FC5) predicts who will respond more to neurofeedback with AutoTrainBrain (Pearson correlation coeff: 0.78, P<0.001). When we reduce the high theta brain waves with neurofeedback in this area, we hypothesize that better cortical regulation and inhibition are developed in the brain, therefore the response to neurofeedback increases. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Most bone diseases occur due to abnormalities of calcium and phosphate homeostasis and deficiencies during remodeling. Due to the limited osteoinductive capacity of scaffolds, mineralization and osteointegration of these scaffolds are limited. Therefore, bioactive peptides are widely used for scaffold modification to stimulate their influence. In the literature, it is shown that surface modification with glutamic acid templated peptides is effective on nucleation and crystallization of hydroxyapatite. The aim of this study was to evaluate thr effect of surface modification with various number of glutamic acids containing peptides on cell viability, proliferation and mineralization. PLGA (Poly-lactide-co-glycolide) electrospun nanofibers (NFs) were conjugated with peptides including different repetitive glutamic acid and mineralized into SBF (stimulated body fluid). Then, MSCs (Mesencymal Stem Cells) were seeded on NFs. Mineralization amount on NFs were evaluated by Ca Assay and XRD (X-Ray diffraction). It was observed that proliferation and mineralization were significantly higher on the two glutamic acid (GLU) containing peptide conjugated groups compared to other groups. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The frequency analysis is performed by Fourier transform for each EEG channel of each patient before and after TMS treatment. Here, changes in EEG data of depressed patients with TMS treatment are analyzed using signal processing techniques in MATLAB\u00ae. The frequency analyses are obtained from Fourier Transform for each EEG channel of patients before TMS and after TMS treatment. Then these frequency values are compared for each patient. Also the respective IMF (intrinsic mode function) values of each channel are analyzed using the MEMD (Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition) algorithm. In this way, the alpha rhythm of EEG datas are detected and the changes in the alpha rhythm of each channel before and after treatment were analyzed. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This approach is based on the determination of the polyp location using the vessel density in colon images. Primarily, we used pre-processing procedures on the colon images, and then blood vessel extraction techniques were employed. Later, segmentation of the vessel boundaries was performed. With the help of vessel boundaries we calculated the vessel density, and used this for the localization of the polyps. We tested the success of this approach using a publicly available image set (CVC-ClinicDB database). This database consisted of 612 images from 29 different polyps. This approach succeeds in correct detection of 24 out of 29 different polyps. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

For correct diagnosis and treatment planning, it is important to know the light propagation in tissue, how much it penetrates, and the optical parameters of the tissue. In order to determine the optical properties of the tissue, diffuse reflectance and diffuse transmittance measurements are needed. These measurements can be performed by using integrating sphere systems. In this study, the optical properties of chicken liver tissue has been obtained with a single-integrating sphere system and the inverse adding-doubling software. Absorption coefficient and reduced scattering coefficient of the chicken liver tissue have been found to be 0.25 mm                             <sup>-1</sup>                              and 0.65 mm                             <sup>-1</sup>                             , respectively.

The purpose of this study is to develop an arrhythmia detection algorithm based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). This algorithm consists of four steps: Preprocessing, Empirical Mode Decomposition, feature extraction and classification. Six arrhythmia types were used for differentiate normal and arrhythmic signals obtained from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database. These are normal (N), left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB), premature ventricular contraction (PVC), paced beat and atrial premature beats (APB). Three different classifiers were used to classify ECG signals. The method achieves better result with accuracy of 87% using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier for detection of normal and arrhythmic signals. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Available low-cost systems mostly aim at monitoring EEG at low sampling rates whereas higher data rates are needed for advanced processing such as signal averaging. In this study, 4-channel EEG acquisition system was developed, with maximum achievable sampling rate of 2000 samples/s for each channel is achieved. The proposed design consists of Data Acquisition (DAQ) hardware and remote receiver module. DAQ hardware amplifies and digitizes EEG and transmits it wirelessly. Remote receiver receives the data and displays the trend in real-time on computer screen. Whole system is mounted on a 6.6 cm x 4.9 cm PCB and is successfully tested in three different experiments: (i) Electrocardiography, (ECG) recording, (ii) EEG recording, with eyes closed, to observe alpha band (8-12 Hz), and (iii) EEG recording, to observe Steady State Visually Evoked Potential (SSVEP) responses. Further studies will involve addition of visual stimuli hardware and trigger-marking channel. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, during post processing, one of the main problems in the extracted data is the presence of high frequency noise signal. To eliminate the noise in the signal filtering methodology is applied. In order to eleminate the noise in the signal low-pass digital filters are commanly used. Here we focus on design of the filters in order to find the optimum method in determination cutoff fequency of the filter. Fourier Frequency Transformation and Residue methods are the two methodes that have been investigated in this study. For this purpose, 'Shoulder Abduction' motion data from 21 (8 male, 13 female) healthy people were collected with a depth camera to obtain 3D positon signal. The collected position data were transferred to the computer for post processing. Using the position data, shoulder movement angles were calculated. The shoulder angle signal with respect to time was analyzed using Cumulative Power Spectral Density (CPSD) and Residue Analysis techniques to estimate better cutoff frequency. The mean values of cutoff frequencies obtained with Residue Analysis and CPSD were 3.121 \u00b1 0.6 Hz and 0.469 \u00b1 0.1 respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the two methods was r =3D 0.501. As a result, the Residue Analysis method proved to produce optimal results in estimation of cut-off frequency. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, as in other cancer treatment methods, dosimetric studies have to be carried out in order to achieve effective treatment. For HIFU applications, dosimetric studies are performed as temperature characterizations on tissue mimicking materials (TMM) that simulate the acoustic properties of the selected tissues. However, due to the acoustical properties of each tissue are different, it is thought that it would give more accurate results by using TMMs which has equivalent acoustic parameters of related tissue while performing temperature characterizations. In this study, the temperature changes resulting from the application of HIFU were determined on two different TMM, which are produced from Agar and Phytagel and have different acoustic parameters, by using thermocouples embedded in TMM. In this manner, temperature values were measured under identical conditions except from acoustical parameters and it was tried to show the dependence of temperature on acoustical parameters. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The complaint in the flare period is the frequent bloody diarrhea. Complaints of people with UC increase and decrease periodically. Colonoscopy is the most preferred approach for the visualization of the gastrointestinal tract for the diagnosis and follow-up of related diseases, and UC in particular. The lack of experience of the colonoscopist, complicated locality of the lesion, and the rush in the colonoscopy suite to complete the procedure as soon as possible may cause mistakes in visual analysis. In this study, 200 colonoscopy images (100 normal, 100 UC) were used. The statistical features such as gray level variance, gray level local variance, normalized variance, histogram range, and entropy were extracted from the images, and a normalized 200x5 feature matrix was formed. The normal images and images with UC were discriminated using support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors. It should be noted that the extraction of only 5 features from the colonoscopy images resulted in 95% accuracy. This study demonstrated the feasibility of the development of software tools for aiding the physicians in the diagnosis of colon diseases. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The evaluation criteria under the standards form the rating criteria of the auditor. Performing of the calibration, labeling and certification in according to the international standards and the examination of the competence of the companies that make the calibration of the medical devices are the points that must be taken into account in the quality studies. However, it is observed that there are nonstandard calibration studies in the sector because of the insufficient control mechanism. It is emphasized that calibration should be made in the HQS evaluation criteria, but there is no detailed guidance information on the quality and adequacy of these measurements. Calibration studies carried out only on the label, which are out of standard, pass the inspection according to the currently used \"Medical Device Management\" evaluation criteria. Performing the auditing mechanism required for the calibration on the HQS evaluation criteria will increase the quality of the calibration service received from the health institution from outside and thus the quality of the health service. Such an inspection mechanism can only be achieved by revising the current HQS \"Medical Device Management\" standard and evaluation criteria. In this statement, HQS \"Medical Device Management\" standards and evaluation criteria were examined and necessary points for revision were determined. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Also eye tracking is a kind of image processing process. In general terms, eye tracking refers to eye movements, image processing or image processing through the input and the recorded data as software. This project was developed for people who are inadequate in terms of use of mouse with hands. In this thesis study, a real-time view can be obtained with the help of colors, eye movement is perceived to be followed and processed, and then to monitor these eye movements using the MATLAB\u00ae program for mouse control by using a webcam.

The maximum and minimum amplitude of the gyro signal, and the ratios of the beta waves of O1 and O2 channel to alpha waves of the same channels were used as threshold values. These threshold values were used to determine the direction of the robotic car. Because of its low-cost and easy implementation, Arduino Uno was used to manage the robotic car. This study has shown that brain waves and head movements can control a device in real time.

However, This research area needs still low cost solutions in order to become widely research topic all around the world. There are leading important reasons at that point which The used equipment is expensive and professional utilities. Many parameters of them are not allowed to changing flexibly in point of increasing effectiveness. In this paper, we cover the developing a low cost and productive BCI hardware and performance results over commercial grade counterparts. In this work, we also developed an active dry electrode which is based on a special pin which is called the pogo pin. Finally, In order to test the developed equipment, the EEG measurements are implemented in Real-Time. The Result shows that The System is able to manage near results to the commercial version while is maintaining reasonable price and providing more portability over them. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, there are not many studies examining the effect of FDT in combination with LEDs. Therefore, in this study, antitumor effect of MB mediated PDT was evaluated by using 635nm LED light source to colon cancer cells. Colon cancer cells were planted in a petri dish and MB was added. 16mW/cm                             <sup>2</sup>                              power density and 3J/cm                             <sup>2</sup>                              energy lavel with 635nm LED were applied to 2s, 6h, 16h, 24h, 48h, 72h after the cells were added to the medium.

These records have been acquired from the database of the Epileptology Department of Bonn University and consisting of 5 marker groups A, B, C, D, E in this study. These records taken from healthy individuals and patients are decomposed into IMFs by EMD method. Feature vectors have been extracted based on Tsallis Entropy, Renyi Entropy, Relative Entropy and Coherence methods. These features are then classified by K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Naive Bayes Classification (NBC).

Grasping performance of the subjects is evaluated based on the measured error, which is the level of intrusion of fingers with respect to the boundary of the circle. While performing the task, innocuous pain stimulation is applied to the subjects' arm as a function of the measured error through the hand exoskeleton device.

Dimension and position of the tuning vias are varied to control the orthogonal modes and tune the center frequency of passband within a range of 8 GHz to 10 GHz.

        "abstract": "Today robust and high performance SRAM (static random access memory) cells are highly demanded in industries. The research work discusses the read static noise margin (RSNM) and write static noise margin (WSNM). The proposed NTl2T (Noise tolerant NTl2T) SRAM cell topology consists of distinct read and write access transistors. This eliminates the conflicting design requirements for access transistors which arise in conventional 6T SRAM cell design. It will also increase the read as well as write stability. Two read and one write port enhance the performance of bit cell. The proposed cell eliminates the charge controversy during read and write operation, therefore its VTC curve is similar to ideal VTC curve. In addition, the bit cell shows enhancement in average write read power dissipation. The simulation results shows that the proposed NTl2T SRAM bit cell is more noise tolerant than conventional6T, 8T 10T SRAM cells. The area overhead is l.97x l.67x more than conventional 6T 8T SRAM cell respectively. The compared result of analytical WSNM with SPICE simulation give a little variation of 6.66% for 6T, 6.82% for 8T, 6.98% for 10T and 7.46% for proposed NTl2T. An improvement of l.32x Il.46x Il.l2x in RSNM and l.33x Il.24x /Ll 1\u00d7in WSNM is observed when proposed NTl2T is compared with 6T, 8T and 10T SRAM cells respectively. The maj or challenge is to design high stability SRAM design. The result of the proposed cell has been compared with 32nm HSPICE technology with VDD @ 0.9 V. Further the proposed design is validated by implementation through Register File. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Thus, control of Solar PV-Wind hybrid system is proposed for standalone three phase applications. Solar and Wind sources are integrated at DC link with battery backup. Inverter supplies the load. PV is associated with DC interface by means of boost converter performing MPPT or Desired Power Control (DPC) as required and boosting its output voltage. PMSG usedfor wind energy conversion is further integrated to DC link via rectifier and boost converter to perform Maximum power point Tracking (MPPT). The battery is connected through a bidirectional converter to maintain DC link at a specified level and enable energy displacement as per energy production and load. DPC algorithm allows extracting only desired amount of power form PV according to prevailing load requirements. It thus can also prevent deep discharging or overcharging of battery. This improves system efficiency and battery life. The inverter performance is enhanced by using synchronous reference frame transformation for its control which helps in regulation of AC output voltage, getting exact data about load's active power component and diminishing complexity of control. Its control is such that output voltage and frequency is maintained. PV Boost, bidirectional converter and inverter are operated in inner current control and outer voltage control mode. This provides better performance with accurate tracking of references. All analytical, simulation and partial hardware results are included. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Traditionally, environmental monitoring systems are expensive and are installed at fixed locations. This is a distributed approach where the measuring units are sparse and placed remotely from each other. In this paper, we present a transportable environmental monitoring system which will detect the presence of vehicular emissions which is mainly contributed by Carbon Dioxide (CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             ) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) gases together with weather conditions such as temperature and relative humidity of the surrounding atmosphere. The acquired data can be transferred through a Bluetooth module to an Andriod application for continuous visualization. In addition to that, the Andriod application is also designed such that it acquires the geographical coordinates of the cell phone form the inbuilt Global Positioning System (GPS) module and can record the pollution concentration of that specific location and store the records in a designated Web server. We present a preliminary prototype of the system and discuss the implementation challenges and initial experiments.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Time delay exists in communication channel can worsen the dynamic performance of closed loop of power system especially in load frequency control (LFC) problem. Due to time delay or some fault present on a system, some generator outage may take place from any well connected areas. So, in this paper an attempt is made to presents an impact of communication delay on frequency regulation of two area interconnected power system with outage of generator terminal from one area. Pad\u00e9 method is used to model the communication delay. A Proportional integral (PI) control based particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to tune the controller gains. A series of simulation results are performed for various case studies, for the effectiveness of control design method mainly for dynamic response of system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Extensively used speed controller is proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller. Tuning of controller is again a cumbersome task. Normally, the PID controller gains give acceptable results for a low power application drive but when the question of high power application drive arises, an un-tuned PID controller does not provide satisfactory performance. Since, the requirement of tuning of PID is continuously felt; extensively used conventional technique for tuning i.e. Zeigler Nichols (Z-N) method has been considered in this paper. To improve the drive's performance, a proper and continuous tuning of the PID controller is required. Hence, to achieve this objective, and cope with inherent non linearity in PMSM drive, Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) have been proposed as a replacement of conventional PID controller. A comparative study on the performance of the PMSM drive has been carried out in this paper. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The SEIG (Self-Excited Induction Generator) based hydro and single stage solar PV (Photovoltaic) array with an energy storage, are used for electrification and for supplying the uninterruptible power to the critical loads. The proposed MG consists of only single VSC (Voltage Source Converter) and a bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDDC) for power management in standalone MG. The BDDC manages the storage battery charging and discharging currents and extracts the peak power from the solar PV array as well. The proposed control of VSC is based on the adaptive filter, which belongs to the family of LMS (Least Mean Square) and LMF (Least Mean of Fourth Order) algorithms. This control is able to provide load levelling, power management, harmonics mitigation, load balancing, and reactive power compensation. The efficacy of proposed single stage PV-hydro-battery based MG with an adantive control is assessed throuzh exnerimental results. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

At the grid side of proposed SLDTC, a 12- pulse A C- DC conversion and a high pass filter, is utilized to suppress the grid current harmonics to an acceptable level. A 3-level NPC is utilized to improve the performances at the motor end. A SLDTC is utilized to control an IMD, which has good transient response during any required operation of presented IMD. The speed and torque of IM, are estimated by utilizing stationary flux in \u03b1\u00df- frame. A five level torque hysteresis controller technique is proposed in this paper, which significantly reduces the torque ripple of proposed IMD.

Also due to expansion of transmission and distribution network, deregulation, increased applications of power electronic devices and competitive electricity market, makes the Indian grid more complex. This forces the grid to operate close to their operating limits to utilize available assets more effectively. However it causes the grid to operate under highly stressed condition. Therefore operator should be more aware about the operating states of the grid for its smooth functioning. PMU based Wide Area Monitoring System possess effective features that enhances the situational awareness of the of the grid operator against various abnormal condition.

The reliability of a utility tied system with a battery backup is improved by assuring the electricity during the interruption in the grid. The bidirectional controlled converter battery also mitigates the intermittency of PV array under rapid variations in the weather. The extracted maximum power is supplied to the voltage source converter (VSC), which is transferred to the nonlinear loads and utility. The distributed incremental adaptive filter is used to control the VSC with contribution of PV power and the battery. A PV power feed-forward (PVFF) term is incorporated in the current control for injection of active power to the utility as well as to improve the dynamic operation of residential PV-battery microgrid. The effectiveness of PV -battery microgrid is validated experimentally developed in the laboratory. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "India is a county of diversity of geographical structure and having diversity of land in agriculture for different types of crop which cater the needs of living being different areas. The crops are basically dependent upon the geographical structure and climatic conditions of the region. The economy of the country/state majorly depends upon agriculture growth. The crop production is one of the major factors for the development of the country. Due to the less monitoring and prediction on crop led to the destruction of agriculture on large scales. The climatic conditions depend on humidity, temperature, wind velocity and other environmental parameters. The humidity and temperature play the major role for rainfall in the north east region. The maize crop is basically one of the main crop of north eastern region and it's dependent upon the rainfall. This paper proposed a prediction model for the maize production using fuzzy logic technique for maize production in north east region. The model show the production of maize in north eastern region and enhance the quality and quantity of production. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Tuning of proportional plus integral controller's parameters with various optimization techniques like Particles Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimization, Gravitational Search Algorithm GSA) and Firefly Algorithm (FA) have been done using two different performance indices as objective functions. Power mismatch between overall generation to the total load plus system losses may results in variation of frequency from their desired value and also causes variation in interconnected tie-line power flow. System performance has been analysed with step load change in hydro-thermal system. Simulation results reveal the performance of all the three optimization techniques in terms of Tie-line power and the frequency deviation in both the areas. Comparison has also been made between the two different performance indices criteria (IAE, ITAE). \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Visual communication or video processing needs video stabilization as a pre-requisite for applications like computer vision or visual tracking. Most of the visual tracking algorithms assume that the input video is stabilized. It is very hard to find any available literature of visual tracking which takes unstabilized video as input for target detection and tracking. It is observed that most of the videos recorded using hand-held camera or camera mounted on a vehicle (tank, ship, aircraft) suffer from unstabilization due to the unwanted hand/vehicle motions coupled with the camera. Target detection is a prime requirement for visual tracking. A novel algorithm is developed which auto-detects the target and uses these parameters to stabilize the video itself. This developed algorithm calculates the local and global motion vectors simultaneously. Local motion vector is used for target detection/tracking while global motion vector is used for video stabilization. Target of interest is identified in frame and different samples of target are taken around the target coordinate. These target samples are then deposited in positive and negative repositories using classifier method. Training of samples of object is carried out for the detection of object coordinate in the next frame. Object coordinate difference between current and just previous frame provides the intentional motion. Consecutive image frames are compensated to get digital video stabilization. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The main cause of Diabetic Retinopathy is high blood sugar levels over a long period of time in the retina known as Diabetes Mellitus. The primary goal is to automatically classify patients having diabetic retinopathy and not having the same, given any High-Resolution Fundus Image of the Retina. For that an initial image processing has been done on the images which includes mainly, conversion of coloured (RGB) images into perfect greyscale and resizing it. Then, a Deep Learning Approach is applied in which the processed image is fed into a Convolutional Neural Network to predict whether the patient is diabetic or not. This methodology is applied on a dataset of 30 High Resolution Fundus Images of the retina. The results, so obtained are a 100 % predictive accuracy and a Sensitivity of 100 % also. Such an Automated System can easily classify images of the retina among Diabetic and Healthy patients, reducing the number of reviews of doctors. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Solar PV powered Hybrid vehicles need a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) scheme which should have a capability of extremely fast tracking performance required during fast varying atmospheric conditions and shading due to the presence of trees, buildings on road sides. This paper presents a new maximum power point tracking technique for PV system with extremely fast convergence speed and restricted searching area. This will increase the tracking efficiency and overall performance of the PV based system. Assessment and comparison of the proposed MPPT algorithm are done with Perturb and Observe (PO) method. A 250 Watt PV system was simulated and analysed. Finally, the practical results were obtained using the hardware set up made for 250 Watt PV Panel and Arduino microcontroller development board. The results show that the proposed Fast Alterable Duty (FAD) MPP Tracking technique is substantially better than PO. The attractiveness of this scheme is the limit imposed on the range of voltage, this range of voltage is where the operating points try to remain even if the atmospheric conditions change at a fast rate. This range of voltage keeps on updating according to the real time values of panel temperature and Irradiance. Enhancement in speed is observed because of this limit imposed on voltage range and also because of the novel variable duty step size (Duty of DC-DC converter used) proposed in this article. This new maximum power point tracking technique will result in extremely fast tracking with increased efficiency. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, Maryland parallel manipulator is being examined, having 3-degrees-of-freedom (DOF). For the dynamic analysis, three different sequential trajectories are considered. The major concern is the nonlinearities and disturbances, which are always associated with the parallel manipulators and it is observed that the process and measurement noise can be rejected by using Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller. For the designing and to control the trajectory of the examined manipulator, the weighting matrices Q R must be optimally selected. Three different methods for tuning Q R weighted matrices are proposed i.e. (i) Trial and Error, (ii) Algebraic Approach and (iii) Genetic Algorithm (GA). The performance analysis of LQG is being simulated by MATLAB. Finally, after designing and tuning of LQG the results of all three different methods of tuning are compared, and it are found that in case of LQG-GA the trajectory tracking is better and efficient as compared to other two methods. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, we have designed a robot as an automated crawler for movement over pipeline terrain. These designed crawlers certainly have to move in vertical direction carrying some payload to perform their assigned task accurately at a specific height. To accomplish the above-discussed conditions, climbing crawler must possess a certain set of rules related to locomotion and adhesion of the robot for slip-free and smooth motion over a vertical pipeline. Based on literature survey and comparative analysis on shape, size, energy efficiency and mobility of different robots with mechanical examination of different characteristics of design with locomotion technique a compliant, encapsulated caged type wheel-driven robot with gripping adhesion mechanism has been developed and tested in this research, with payload capacity of about 200 gms over a ferromagnetic pipeline of scale used in different oil or gas refineries. The developed and tested encapsulated caged prototype crawler presented in this paper has cost-effectiveness as its major distinctive feature with small in size and simple in structure. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper enlists various type of Multiphysics simulation of the complete system and at sun- component levels to tackle the engineering challenges that accompanied the creation of this radical new design. Among the various proposed configurations of feeder pillars, a compact vertical feeder pillar is modelled and simulated as per the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard test requirement and evaluated in terms of accuracy and ease-of-use. The simulations models are designed to evaluate the short circuit withstanding capability of the FPB system and temperature rise under full loading condition that has helped to redesign the FPB system configuration with the lowest footprint possible. In additions, the FEM model is created to assure the structures integrity of the entire system that includes enclosures, three phase panels, novel termination connectors and fuses housing. The models so developed are validated experimentally with an in-house developed prototype. Based on the model, a simulation methodology is developed and used to perform analysis for various type test requirements. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

For reasons like decision making, finding co-relations or figuring out differences among the data it is mandatory to traverse through the whole huge collection of data. Examining such huge data collections or complex ontologies in context of semantic web may take too long and will be additional overhead. Along with extra time period it may occupy larger space as well. To replace the already existing data mining techniques another simpler approach has been introduced known as Clustering. Clustering is the scheme of placing together similar items in one cluster and separating the dis-similar ones. Clustering technique decomposes complex ontologies into simpler small data sets. These decomposed data sets save time and memory when it comes to information retrieval or query processing in semantic web. This paper proposed two optimized algorithms K-ENRICH and FC-ENRICH for ontology clustering and comparative analysis of these algorithms with some existing algorithms using various attributes that are F-measure, similarity and entropy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, for under-developed and developing countries, language diversity from international community is posing an important hurdle in their progress. It has been well-established that every individual's best intellectual ability is reflected through his/her mother tongue. So, to bridge the gap of global advancements and to capture research essence of international dominion comprehendible to various native languages, this paper proposes an approach of context-based translation, and unifying it with OCR-scanning function in a simplified architecture. The proposed architecture is further developed as PiScanner for economical and convenient OCR-scanning with context-based translation functionality and new language support, which is rarely available. PiScanner's architecture additionally supports text-to-speech conversion, with Google's text-to-speech APls, to provide audio output of context-based translated text for visually-challenged individuals. PiScanner has been thoroughly experimented to demonstrate its applicability. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Military surveillance during pitch dark night conditions is of prime importance for the security of any nation. Medium Wave Infra Red (3-5\u03bcm) or Long Wave Infra Red (8-12\u03bcm) thermal cameras are used in the border areas for reconnaissance. Automatic target detection and tracking in these Infra Red (IR) videos is very important for alertness and preaction. This paper presents an algorithm for detecting and tracking a target in IR video. IR image characteristics are utilized for the detection of target using Fast Fourier Transform, followed by Boosted Butterworth high pass filter to sharpen the image and increase the contrast between the target and its surroundings. Then proper thresholding and blob analysis is performed to detect the target. Then target is tracked using centroid matching function. Machine learning concept is used to develop trajectory prediction algorithm with dynamic indexing of weight of rate of change in angle with respect to the horizontal axis to handle both linear and non-linear trajectories. Experimental results show that the developed algorithm is robust for target detection and tracking in IR videos and is capable of handling human as well as vehicle targets moving in linear or non-linear fashion. The algorithm successfully predicts the target even if the target is occluded partially or fnlly over several frames. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

To provide the considerably better coding efficiency as compared to the existing video coding standards, a next generation video coding standard High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is released. HEVC introduces the concept of flexible Coding Unit (CU) size, and the number of intra-prediction angular modes i.e. 35. The newly introduced features highly contribute to the better performance of HEVC, but they also significantly increase the computational complexity. In this paper, a frame context based study of intra-prediction modes is carried out to investigate the behavior of different modes over different context frames, so that, the HEVC complexity reduction work can be abetted. As a performance metric, the frequency of different modes over different textured images and Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) for randomly selected Prediction Blocks (PBs) are pictorially presented. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "                             Speech signal processing is used in many applications. There exist situations where conversation takes place under high noise environment. A specific example is the telephonic conversations held at airport with background aeroplane sound. Other examples are the conversation held in industrial environment with high noise machines, in railway stations etc. In all of these conditions, conversation (voice signal) get corrupted by background sound (noise) reducing its intelligibility. Thus, the need arises for an effective method that helps in reducing the background noise thereby increasing clarity of the conversation. Wavelet Transform (WT) is widely used for audio, image and video signal processing. This paper presents a wavelet-based approach to reduce the effect of background noise. This approach is compared with the standard, freely available softwares such as Audacity, Wavepad and Ocenaudio which are widely used for the purpose of noise reduction. The AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise) is assumed to be a model of background noise. Using extensive simulation study and analysis which is carried out using MATLAB                             <sup>\u00ae</sup>                             2016a, WT based approach is found to perform better than the other standard softwares that are considered here. Correlation co-efficient is considered as a measure of performance improvement by the WT approach over the other software. The work has useful implications in various applications in which speech signal gets degraded by background noise.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Considering a group of 20 customers with a Distribution Channel (DC) acts as an Aggregator, which are willing to participate in Demand response (DR) and in Energy Market (EM). Firstly, each customer load scheduling of appliances is done with Delayable Appliances and Non-Delayable Appliances using forecasted Day-Ahead Price, where Non-Delayable Appliance can reduce their power and Delayable Appliances can delay their operation time with in the time period limit set by the customer in a day. The cumulative load information goes to Distribution channel which re-adjusts again only Delayable Appliances. Distribution Channel adjustment is divided into two cases, viz., first with respect to available power and, second with respect to the price of power at that time. Some customers are having solar PV as a generation with battery storage. The scheduling of appliances is assumed as an optimization problem and solved through Genetic Algorithm Optimization (GAO). The results from Day-ahead and Hour-ahead scheduling can help in matching closely load for real-time consumption. This method has social benefits, which benefits the customer as well as utility. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In the present paper for verifying the o\u25a1ine signature, a small 3-layer deep convolutional neural network followed by a fully connected layer is proposed, whose trainable parameters are several orders of magnitude fewer than previously reported in literature. This network has been used in two dierent configurations: firstly as a feature extractor in hybrid classifier and secondly as an end to end classifier in Siamese network. In hybrid classifier scheme, support vector machine is used for verifying the genuineness of the signature. Siamese network contains two or more identical subnetworks joined by one or more fully connected layers. The proposed neural network is used as subnetwork in Siamese network. Both hybrid classifier and Siamese network are tested for both Writer independent (WI) and dependent (WD) verification on 3 datasets: CEDAR, GPDS Synthetic Signature, BHSig260. The proposed approach achieves percentage accuracy of 99.91, 92.28, 86.88, 90.58 in Hybrid classifier scheme, 99.87, 92.14, 86.33, 90.80 in Siamese network for WD verification and 80.26, 75.06, 89.33, 82.42 in Siamese network for WI verification in CEDAR, BENGALI, HINDI and GPDS respectively. Experimental results show that the verification accuracy for HINDI in WI outperforms the state of art approaches. The proposed approach has also achieved comparable performance in CEDAR and BENGALI for WD verification. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "                             A typical image coder generally consists of a transform stage followed by quantization and coding stages. The memory requirement of an image coder would be the maximum of both the stages and complexity would be the sum of both stages. Due to large memory requirements, most of the existing image coders are unsuitable for their implementation on memory-constrained-platforms especially for high-resolution images. In this paper, we propose a low memory approach, Block-based Fractional Wavelet Filter (BFrWF), to compute wavelet transform coefficients of high-resolution images. Furthermore, BFrWF can be combined with low memory wavelet-based image coding algorithms to design low-memory image codec. Evaluation results show that the BFrWF requires less than 10 kB of RAM (available over most of the low-cost sensor nodes) even for high-resolution (HR) images, thus making it suitable for visual sensor networks. Moreover, the proposed BFrWF implemented with 8 blocks has 25.64                             <sup>%</sup>                              less complexity than FrWF and 80.45% less complexity than segmented FrWF (SFrWF) implemented with partitioning of an image line into 8 segments (SFrWF - a low memory variant of FrWF) for HR-image of dimension 2048\u00d72048.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Compression of an image involves reducing its size to some extent without much changes in its quality and the contents. Compression of medical images plays a significant role in the field of telemedicine. For example, treatment of patients at places where specialized doctors are not available requires transmission of the medical images to places where the required doctors are available. Since medical data is huge in size, it requires high bandwidth at both the sender side as well as the receiver side. Compressed medical images can also be stored in a standard database which may be accessed by doctors and researchers for their case studies. It has already been proved that mostly the human body possess bilateral symmetry. This means that an organ of the human body can be divided into two symmetrical halves by simply drawing a vertical line down their centers. This paper presents a new approach for compressing the medical images by making use of their symmetry feature. This approach helps in compressing the medical images to a greater extent. This method involves transmission of any one of the symmetrical half of the image along with the differential information of the two halves in encoded form. At the receiver end, the original image can be regenerated without much observable changes. The proposed approach also determines the best pair of compression techniques for encoding the two parts of the image to be transmitted. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a grid-interactive doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based wind energy conversion system (WECS) for regulated power flow through the grid. The battery energy storage (BES) is used for maintaining regulated power along the grid regardless of the wind speeds. The rotor side converter (RSC) is controlled in flux based reference frame and the grid side converter (GSC) control is based on an indirect vector control. The BES is connected at DC bus of two voltage source converters integrated back to back, which plays key role in attaining regulated grid power. This work proposes control algorithms for both RSC and GSC to achieve regulated power flow capabilities in the grid. The system is modeled and its performance is simulated under variable wind speeds, change in grid reference real and reactive powers, grid voltage dip and unbalanced nonlinear load conditions using SimPowerSystems toolbox of MATLAB. Under all such cases, the grid currents, stator currents and PCC (point of common coupling) voltages are found sinusoidal and THDs (total harmonic distortions) are under limits as per the IEEE 519 standard. Finally, a prototype is developed and experiment has been carried out to test the grid-interactive DFIG based WECS under changeover of grid power and variable wind speeds. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Nowadays, peoples are paying more attention toward the use of this turbine to harness the hydrokinetic potential. The profile of the blade is the main parameter to decide the power output of Darrieus hydrokinetic turbine. Therefore, an attempt has been made to select a suitable blade profile for Darrieus hydrokinetic turbine in order to enhance the power output. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based numerical analysis has been carried out in a commercial available software (ANSYS Fluent (v.18.1)). Four different blade profiles (two symmetrical and two unsymmetrical) namely NACA 0018, NACA 0010, S 9000 and S 1046 are selected for comparative study. 2D Numerical investigations are carried out around the Darrieus hydrokinetic turbine rotor and SST k-\u03c9 turbulence model has been used for the solution of Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid flow distributions of pressure and velocity around the turbine blades corresponding to each profile is analyzed and discussed. Based on the numerical analysis, it is concluded that un-symmetrical S-1046 blade profile is found to be the superior airfoil in terms of power coefficient and self-starting capability. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The proposed approximate multiplier least mean square (AMLMS) control algorithm for an off-grid voltage source converter (VSC) system is effective for reduction of power disturbances without disturbing the power quality (PQ). Moreover, the VSC control algorithm focuses on reduction of complexity of LMS by adding multipliers in the finite impulse response (FIR) filter and in updating coefficient in circuitry. Moreover, a synchronous reluctance generator (SyRG) based pico-hydropower generation at the AC side is used because of its reliability, and cost-effectiveness than other brushless generators. The VSC control is projected for islanded microgrid comprising of photovoltaic (PV) array, and a bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDC) at the DC side. The BDC with a storage battery, maintains the optimal power flow to provide the power equilibrium between load and sources through DC bus voltage regulation. Moreover, BDC mitigates the second harmonic current from the battery charging and discharging current. Experiment results ensure the validation and effectiveness of nronosed controller. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A video sequence consists of several hundred frames, and as a result, creating a panoramic image from these frames is a challenging task because video may have moving objects and the objects may appear at different depths. Computer vision is a field that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information. One of the sub domain is generating panoramas from video which have applications in aero photography, satellite generated photographs to be stitched for research. Our aim is to design a Panorama Generation System that takes a video as input and captured by a moving camera navigating through a scene and our goal is to generate a panoramic summary of the scene and for this purpose remove moving and foreground objects. The panorama process receives two dimensional video from video camera. The received video includes set of image frames and the frames together form a panorama image. To build panorama image from video, we use the motion model based on color invariant features in order to apply our algorithm in a scene where there are illumination, highlights and shadows. After that, key frames/regions are selected for the following image fusion process. At last, the input frames are transformed to the same coordinate to fuse a panorama. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Building on developments in machine learning and prior work in the science of behaviour prediction, we construct a model designed to predict the behaviour of Consumer. The aim of this research paper is to examine the relation between consumer behaviour parameters and willingness to buy. First we investigate to find relationship between consumer behaviour to buy products on changing parameters such as environmental factor, organizational factor, individual factor and interpersonal factor. Thus this paper proposes time-evolving random forest classifier that leverages unique feature engineering to predict the behaviour of consumer that affect the choice of purchasing the product significantly. Results of random forest classifier are more accurate than other machine learning algorithm. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It is used to overcome the problem of balanced realization technique such as steady state problem. In this method, the balanced realization technique is used for evaluating the denominator of the simplified system and the numerator is derived by factor division algorithm. This methodology guarantees the stability of the reduced system and preservation of static behavior of the original model. A standard multi-variable system is taken from the literature for illustrating the effectiveness of the suggested technique. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this proposed system, a bi-directional DC-DC converter (BDC) with a battery energy storage (BES) is coupled to to voltage source converter (VSC). A bi-directional converter, whose input is BES, is used to control the DC-link voltage of the VSC. Along with the DC-link voltage, it also maintains active power balance in the system. The BDC enables to use a BES with reduced rating of 250V, while the DC-link voltage is always maintained at 380 V. The battery provides load leveling by charging during lightly loaded conditions. When the connected load exceeds more than PMSG based pico-hydro generation, then the excess power is delivered by the BES. The power quality improvement of the system along with VFC is realized using a VSC. The VSC along with VFC also takes care of other power quality problems like harmonics and load unbalancing. A sparse least mean square (SLMS) based control algorithm is used to estimate fundamental component of load currents and to generate reference source currents for VSC control. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The reason behind it is that it has taken more human lives than any other disease. According to data of American Cancer Society, in USA alone half a million people will die because of cancer in 2018. Further this disease has a lot of different types which affects a whole lot of people varying in age and gender. Cancer even after all this is still a curable disease, but the problem with it that makes it so dangerous is late detection. If detected at early stages it can very easily be treated. Ovarian cancer is one of the categorization of cancer which has a very low survival rate often because of late detection and diagnosis. In this article a non invasive sensor mechanism has been proposed for detection of ovarian cancer. This method will result in a portable device that can be used for giving an early diagnosis of ovarian cancer and can easily be used at home. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A step by step design procedure is discussed for a proposed structure using CMA modal significance. By analyzing Characteristic angle, eigenvalues and modal significance in systematic design approach, help us to achieve good S                             <sub>11</sub>                              (<-10dB) and S                             <sub>21</sub>                              (<-15dB) in the desired bands. In the presented work first single band MIMO antenna is evolved by identifying desired resonating modes and undesired non-resonating modes using CMA. The desired single band is achieved by tuning the non-resonating modes in the design. The presence of undesired non-resonating modes influence the mutual coupling between the antenna, and as a result of that, it diminished the performance of MIMO antenna. To minimize the impact of mutual coupling; Defected Ground Structure (DGS) and stubbing in the ground plane is introduced. The proposed design shows good envelope correlation coefficient (ECC), diversity gain, and Gain in the operating bands.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper critically addresses the impact of technology advancement and spacing on crosstalk induced delay and peak noise for copper and multi-layered graphene nanoribbon (MLGNR) based global on-chip interconnects. In order to demonstrate the crosstalk effect, this paper presents the multi-conductor transmission line (MTL) model of MLGNR that can be further simplified to an equivalent single conductor (ESC) model with a negligible tolerance below 0.91% irrespective of interconnect lengths and spacing. Using the proposed ESC model, the crosstalk induced delay and noise are analyzed for a coupled driver-interconnect-load setup. It is observed that the MLGNR possesses a negligible crosstalk effect at an advanced technology node in comparison to Cu interconnects. At 14 nm technology node, the overall crosstalk induced delay of MLGNR can be reduced by 48.1% with respect to Cu in comparison to 32 nm node at global interconnect lengths. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The key contribution of this article is to design a reduced size of MSA using modified Sierpinski gasket structure and to achieve multiband applications. The parametric performance of RSSG fractal antenna has been completed using HFSS simulation software. The antenna resonates at different frequencies at 6.95 GHz, 15.77 GHz, 18.24 GHz, 20.91 GHz and 25.63 GHz bands, respectively. The multiband behavior of the designed antenna is obtained which works well for C-band, Ku- band, and K-band Application. The simulated result shows that the proposed technique outperforms conventional approaches significantly. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Each 32 bit real floating multiplier requires a 24 bit fixed point real multiplier for mantissa multiplication. Based on the Indian Vedic mathematics sutra called URDHVA TIRYAKBHYAM, two architectures for 24\u00d724 bit Vedic real multiplier are proposed for mantissa multiplication in 32 bit floating point real multiplier. The two architectures are evaluated to choose one having less path delay for use in the proposed complex floating point multiplier. The four floating point real multipliers solution for the proposed multiplier is coded in VHDL for implementation on Kintex-7 FPGA. Finally, the results of the proposed multiplier are compared with that of the Booth and Array multipliers. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Towards the objective, sensor calibrations are performed using comparison method at Calibration Laboratory where the setup consists of electro-dynamic shaker which has an armature with attached reference sensor. The reference accelerometer's armature had become non functional since the coil got damaged and therefore not available for calibration tasks. Support services not being offered by Original Equipment Manufacturer or other sources due to obsolescence is common scenario and it poses several challenges and opportunities. Approach and efforts taken towards ameliorating the situation involve analysing past constraints, root cause studies and implementing corrective actions, additional software development, hardware rectification, overcoming re-calibration fixture issues etc. to reinduct the system successfully into service. The simple philosophy to make the facility' Better than New' with tasks involving creating an inventory of parts, development of specialised tooling, software and control procedure adopted is brought as the key aspect for sustenance of such efforts in this paper. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Improvement in off-state breakdown voltage has been seen from the device having thicker channel with n-cap doping and negative FP misalignment length. Enhancement in n-cap doping also results in the improvement in breakdown voltage. However reverse effect has been observed with p-cap layer. Irrespective of poor off-state breakdown voltage, higher I                             <sub>on</sub>                             /I                             <sub>off</sub>                             ratio, lower sub-threshold slope and better transconductance can be achieved with FP-AIGaN/GaN having thinner channel HEMT. But the cut-off frequency deteriorates with reduction in channel thickness at lower gate voltage (-5V). Lateral FP misalignment and cap layer type and doping has marginal influence on gate to source capacitance.

In this proposed scheme, all types of distribution network faults are detected and isolated with a suitable optimal coordination time interval (CTI). The proposed method is tested on IEEE 6-Bus radial distribution system (RDS). The fault analysis results show the current, voltage and impedance waveforms. New operating characteristics is experimented for DR, and parameters are analyzed with respect to a trip signal, resulting in a suitable range of CTI. The results indicate that the proposed combined relay coordination scheme is capable of providing reliable time margin between DR and OCRs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Multi-Static-Radar (MSR) systems are emerging technology due to exploitation of spatial diversity nature, offering improved Performance for various configuration of deployment of vis a vis mono-static radar. The deployment challenges becomes more difficult when all radar are considered as airborne radar and creates scenario of Multi-Dynamic radar(MDR). The radar signal characteristics for MDR scenario dynamically changing based on geometrical configuration. The Transmit and Receive pairs in MDR case is considered on moving airborne-platform such that Airborne radar with multiple receiver(Rx) mounted on different Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), such configuration considered as Multi-dynamic radar for airborne surveillance systems. Space Time Adaptive Processing(STAP) is considered as multi-dimensional adaptive-filtering algorithms that simultaneously combine and process the signals received from the array elements (spatial domain) and multiple pulses (Temporal domain) of coherent radar waveform to suppress the interference. STAP for multi-dynamic radar scenario improve detection of stealth or low rcs targets obscured by mainlobe clutter and jamming environments as detection performance depends on Receivers coordinated network. A typical interference scenario involves the detection of a low rcs targets(SNR) in the presence of a large interfering signal, it is desirable to attenuate the interfering signal while preserving the integrity of low rcs target and an appropriate dynamic range. This paper discusses the reduced rank algorithm to reduce the rank of sample covariance matrix in sample starved homogeneous environment. The two solutions namely, multi-stage Weiner filter and Principal Component (PC) have been shown.

In industrial applications, data generation rate of sensor nodes is abrupt in nature. Due to which, buffer overflow is started in few of the sensor nodes and hence overall throughput decreases. A new algorithm has been proposed in the present work for IEEE 802.15.4 standard MAC protocol to handle abrupt data generation rate efficiently and to avoid buffer overflow. Proposed algorithm utilizes K-means based aggregation function to halt buffer overflow. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm beats the standard IEEE 802.15.4 MAC protocol in terms of percentage throughput and energy consumption with low mean square error (MSE). \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper presents a methodology to design the droop value based on the concept that voltage response time depends on converter end capacitors and the number of terminals responsible for controlling the DC voltage. The effect of proposed droop is investigated on number of droop controlled terminals in use. A five terminal HVDC system is considered to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology. The said system is analysed for both ideal and non-ideal DC grid. The study shows that with proposed droop, converters can be utilised to their maximum limit. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The PV array is utilized at maximum power through maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique namely perturb and observe (PO) algorithm. The solar array is used to feed to the grid via a voltage source converter (VSC) for transfer of power to the grid and the load in a distribution system. In addition, it also provides compensation of reactive power and elimination of harmonics. With the utilization of proportional integral (PI) control, the voltage level across the DC link of VSC is sustained at the reference voltage obtained from the MPPT. A digital infinite impulse response (IIR) peak filter is used for control of VSC by the extraction of load current fundamental component and generation of switching pulses of VSC. A feed-forward PV power term is incorporated for improvement of dynamic behavior of the system. A prototype of the system is developed in the laboratory and its performance is studied for varying load and solar insolation conditions. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, 6-day-a-head solar radiation forecasting has been done using various multivariate ANN models. For this, Feed forward Neural Network, Back Propagation Neural Network, Deep Learning Neural Network and Model Averaged Neural Network have been compared on the basis of various Statistical Indicators. One year data has been used for this analysis which has been collected from Solar Radiation Resource setup in Gorakhpur, India. Nine parameters namely Time, Average Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Maximum Temperature, Rain, Wind, Dew, Atmospheric and Azimuth have been selected as input variable to ANN. To accurately examine the models, models have been applied for January to December month forecasting. From the results, it has been found that Model Averaged Neural Network presents best results whereas Back Propagation Neural Network presents worst results. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Long duration walking and standing can result in hypoxia which refers to the low level of oxygen at various parts of the body. Active reflexology Actuating and footwear mapping allow to monitor and regulate health in a smarter way. It provides a solution for optimized blood flow by using the technique of acupuncture.

In this approach, the nodes which are outside the rendezvous region follow the clustering phenomenon. On the other hand, some nodes inside the rendezvous region are selected as RNs which are closest to their cluster heads and rest are treated as normal nodes which can transmit its data directly to the mobile sink. The simulation results verified that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than the optimizing LEACH. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It is highly possible, by mobile networks to provide any time and any where communication strategy, which meets the user requirements. However, the rising demand for multimedia, interactive and high quality of services on mobile network platform has made the existing mobile technologies to be reconsidered and reengineered. The 4G technology is one such platform that addresses the challenges in conventional mobile communication network. In this regard, 4G Long Term Evolution (4G -LTE) has promised to be effective solution to meet the future challenge of dynamism in all dimension of mobile communication. This work primarily focuses on reviewing the LTE mobile technology, the various challenges in designing LTE network and the issues in LTE while performing intended operations. Specifically, in LTE network design, the optimization of capacity allocation in LTE backhaul network is one of the most challenging issues due to high dynamic nature of mobile network communications and components. Such optimization problems are hard to solve in polynomial time. Next, this work addresses the reduction of LTE capacity allocation problem as NP complete using subset sum problem. Further, adaptive iterative local search algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. The experimental results exhibited the efficiency of proposed algorithm as 67% improvement in computation time in comparison of greedy method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The conventional series-fed patch array (SFPA) has limited scanning range and directivity due to low radiation capability of the rectangular patch i.e. unit cell. In this work, the leaky band performance of the unit cell has been improved by truncating the edge of the rectangular patch and loading of balanced shorting pins. The proposed antenna is a series-fed 8 unit cell structure. The antenna has a wide leaky band of 57 % from 10 GHz to 18 GHz with center frequency 14 GHz and the maximum simulated directivity of 19 dBi. It shows forward, broadside and backward scanning capability with a scanning range of 91\u25a1 (from +66\u25a1 to -25\u25a1). Thus the proposed unit cell structure can be effective to reduce the required antenna array length for high directivity. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Partial Discharge (PD) is one of the phenomena that occur in the insulators and gaps between the windings of the power transformer that may be harmful for its health. In this study, a simulation model of an insulator, i.e. epoxy resin, defected with a cylindrical void is taken to generate PD activity and its analysis. Under the analysis PD waveform, PD pulses with higher magnitudes are identified and their characteristics in time and time-frequency transformed domain are studied. Some of the features are amplitude, occurrence, frequency distribution, intensity of the frequencies, etc. PD waveforms are obtained and studied on different supply voltages and different void size. Time domain feature are computed directly from the samples of the PD waveform and Time-Frequency analysis is performed by applying Short Time Fourier Transform. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Generally, a small power backup source is utilized for necessary loads (emergency lights and emergency loads like fan and small cooler). Nowadays, grid-connected solar inverters that installed on the roof are widely utilized for backup power source in urban cities. Penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) are increasing, so charging of EVs battery through grid increase power grid instability. Solar PV based charging of EVs can be a solution for this problem. However, in the case of a charged battery condition, whenever battery has charged through the grid, the available power from solar PV modules remain unutilized and wasted. The proposed controllers modify the regular, low-cost home inverter into a PV grid-connected inverter that it also has the ability to utilize EV battery energy. It has better control strategy that guarantees the reliability of the power supply. Economy mode and reliable mode has been developed to improve standby power supply, it also maximizes utilization of PV energy. In addition, the customers, don't need to buy a new expensive solar grid-connected inverter or any other devices to charge the EV battery if they already have a home-based inverter. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The off state current calculation (Io                             <sub>FF</sub>                             ) has been performed at the V                             <sub>GS</sub>                             =0V by keeping the V                             <sub>DS</sub>                             =0.5V and also calculated the drain current at different values of V                              <sub>GS</sub>                             for decreasing channel length and oxide thickness in nanoscale range. It has been observed that at 1nm oxide thickness, the Io                             <sub>FF</sub>                             current has the minimum value at the channel length of 5nm. On the other side, for higher channel length, the I                             <sub>OFF</sub>                             current also reduces at oxide thickness of 1nm but device channel length get increased. If the oxide thickness has been taken 3.5nm, the I                             <sub>OFF</sub>                             current increases at 5nm channel length, which is not desirable for the nanoscale devices.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Subsequently, it also discusses different organic sensitive materials for substrates and electrodes that are very useful for humidity sensors. The encouragement of using organic materials for humidity sensor is because of their easier deposition, their modifiability and overall low cost. Sensor performance depends on response time, recovery time, sensitivity, selectivity and stability, therefore, these parameters are deeply discussed in this paper. Additionally, based on these performance parameters comparisons of organic humidity sensor materials, their electrical properties such as response time, sensitivity, detection range with respect to change in relative humidity are elaborated in-depth. Moreover, different organic materials used in humidity sensors and their effect on electrical properties are summarized. In the field of research and development, humidity sensors are used for a wide variety of applications including semiconductor industry, medical applications, textile production, food processing and agriculture significantly. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Assistive technologies like text detection and translation are some of the promising applications that emerge as the smart devices gain wide usage. In spite of recent progress in text to speech translation, natural language processing, speech recognition etc. text reading for partially impaired vision remains challenging. In this paper, we present a new Android-based Text Reader application/system that assists partially sighted and elderly people to understand the meaning of the object particularly text presented to them in any formats. This paper presents an application that assists people with partial vision to identify and recognize the surrounding text through a user-friendly interface and helps them to develop a sense of awareness about the environment. Experiments are conducted to prove the efficacy and performance of the proposed system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Different combinations of the three feature sets, namely LR GW, CH GW, LR CH, and LR, CH GW tested on a standard database of Bangla characters revealed that the combination of LR and CH features yielded better recognition accuracy compared to the other cases.

The adaptive state of charge (SoC) based dc power droop is proposed for load sharing among multiple battery energy storage systems (BES). The proposed SoC adaptive droop not only ensures decentralized load sharing but also ensures optimum utilization of battery power and its charging/discharging rates which depends on its present SoC status. Also, integral sliding mode control (SMC) based robust inner current controller for bidirectional de-de converter of BES is presented to track the current references with zero steady state error and with reduced effect of load disturbances. The simulation results present the operation of adaptive SoC droop controlled DC microgrid under load dominating and generation dominating modes with reduced steady state error due to SM C based current controller and improved BES charze/discharae profile. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Machine Learning algorithms are being widely used to make intelligent systems. In Cloud Computing, issues like server consolidation, load balancing and virtual machine to physical machine mapping have been addressed using clustering analysis which is unsupervised learning. It is important that Cloud Service Providers address these challenges in order to provide enhanced user experience and superlative Quality of Service. Neural Networks, which fall under supervised learning algorithms, have emerged tremendously and are used in different areas such as Bio-Informatics, Pattern Recognition and Classification. Using Neural Networks and Back Propagation Algorithm, this work classifies different types of virtual machines that are providing heterogeneous services. Further, the technique is compared to K-means Clustering Algorithm which groups similar types of virtual machines into several clusters. The objective of this work is to form labeled clusters of virtual machines with the help of Neural Networks based on their types and loads and perform server consolidation. The proposed work achieves higher performance in terms of number of virtual machine samples correctly classified, as compared to K-Means Clustering algorithm. Migrating dissimilar virtual machines onto a single physical host improved machine utilization with the trade-off of slight increase in response time of the machines. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This demands implementation of suitable pre-processing techniques for enhancing the image quality. Pre-processing technique includes methods of noise removal as well as contrast enhancement. Fundus images often altered by impulse noise. Meanwhile, quality of retinal fundus image suffers due to nonuniform illumination and low contrast due to anatomy of eye fundus. This paper presents the performance evaluation of joint noise filtering and histogram equalization techniques for the overall quality enhancement of retinal fundus image. In the first stage of the work, two emerging noise-filtering methods namely, NAFSM filter and block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) techniques are implemented for de-noising. In second stage, histogram equalization (HE), adaptive histogram equalization (ADHE), contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), exposure based sub-image histogram equalization (ESIHE) techniques are investigated one by one for obtaining the best suited combination of the filtering and HE methods for the improvement of retinal fundus picture. Performance evaluation of these techniques have been carried out by determining the performance parameters such as histogram, SNR, entropy, absolute mean brightness error and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of processed retinal fundus images. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In today's world, when there is crisis of conventional energy resources, it has become essential to harness energy from non-conventional energy resources. However, the electrical energy obtained through renewable sources is mostly variable or in the form of direct current. The output voltage obtained from solar or wind needs to be converted through either ac-dc-ac or dc-ac converters. The utility grid compatible ac output from these sources can only be applied to home appliances and electrical drives. Thus, an inverter is an indispensable device in the present energy scenario. In the design of inverter, gate pulse generation plays a vital role. There are several techniques available to generate gate pulses. Some of the techniques are space vector modulation (SVM) and sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) which could be used not only for two-level inverters but multilevel inverters as well. Because of ease, a two-level inverter is used for low voltage and low power application whereas, for high voltage and high-power applications, multilevel inverters are best suited. In this paper, an attempt is made to bring out a comparison of the performances of two-level and three-level inverters based on SPWM and SVPWM techniques for linear and non-linear loads based on MATBAB R2016a simulation. The results obtained are presented. The results indicate that the inverter with SVPWM technique performs better than the one with SPWM technique as the former generates less total harmonic distortion (THD) compared to latter for the same load parameters. Also, it is seen that the non-linearity in the load has its effect on the harmonics. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Electro-Thermal characterization for aluminum and copper samples are performed experimentally to understand the electrical contact phenomenon, happening at macroscopic level, at the interface. Dependence of electrical contact resistance and temperature on surface roughness and contact load are analyzed using DOE. FEM analysis is performed using COMSOL\u2122, as a simulation tool, for validation of interface temperature. Electrical Constriction conductance, obtained from FEM analysis, predicted actual contact area for low voltage electrical connectors. Moreover, empirical relations are developed in Minitab\u2122 to calculate the mechanical contact area and interface temperature based on given load, average surface roughness of the interface and electrical contact resistance. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

During last few decades world has witnessed multidimensional development in this area and made this technology acceptable for efficient production of bulk power. Recent research articles and renewable energy market trends have demonstrated the popularity of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind energy conversion system (WECS) for such requirements. Objective of present work is to examine the performance of the cylindrical pole PMSG based wind turbine (WT) interfaced to the grid via back-to-back voltage source converter. Present work focuses on generator performance with zero d-axis current control (ZDC) and maximum torque per ampere control (MTPA), it has been observed that cylindrical rotor PMSG displays identical performance with ZDC and MTPA control. In order to analyze the WECS performance, simulation is done in MATLAB/Simulink platform. Excellent performance is observed and is validated with the obtained performance parameters for the system at steady state. The WECS performance is studied in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) range only. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The usage of electrical components is increases exponentially in electric vehicles over last decade due to advances in power electronics. In this article, performance comparison of bi-directional dc/dc converters over switching loss reduction, efficiency, ripple analysis, cost and size. Those dc/dc converters are Generic Duel Active Bridge (GDAB-IBDC) and Resonant Dual Active Bridge (RDAB-IBDC) isolated bidirectional dc/dc converters. The GDAB-IBDC converter is simple and its controller is not complex compare to resonant dc/dc converter. The simulation is carried out over PSCAD software with 10 ohm constant resistive load. The resonant dc/dc converter has excellent features compare to generic dc/dc converter like higher switching frequency, less switching losses, higher efficiency, more possibility of soft switching of both bridges and lesser circulating current. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It plays an important role in postal automation services especially in a country like India where multiple languages and scripts are used. So, the recognition system needs to deal with many challenges like varying writing styles and cursive nature of handwriting. This paper proposes an effective handwritten numeral recognition approach based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed work is an attempt to develop a recognition system for recognizing the handwritten digits written in any one of the regional languages: Bangla, Devanagari, Oriya, and Telugu. The proposed system first normalizes the input image having single digit thereafter CNN works as a feature extractor while SVM as a classifier. Experiments have been conducted on benchmark database of ISI Kolkata (having numerals of Bangla, Devanagari, and Oriya languages) and CMaterdb (having numerals of Telugu language) (Jadavpur University). The results show that our model performs best for Devanagari language with accuracy 99.41% and for Bangla, Telugu, and Oriya, the accuracies are 99.14%, 99.16%, and 94.54% respectively. So, the performance of the proposed approach is better than state-of-art approaches. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The distributed model has been considered in order to characterize the interdigital capacitor more accurately over wideband of frequencies. Three interdigital capacitors with different number of fingers have been analyzed. From the analysis and observations made from analysis, a generalized distributed T -equivalent circuit model, similar to that of a distributed T -equivalent model for a conventional transmission line, has been presented. A comparison is made between the lumped and distributed equivalent circuit model to present the advantage of the distributed model. This new distributed model can be used in the analysis and design of wideband circuits that uses the interdigitalcapacitors. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

For this purpose, changes occurring in alpha and beta bands are exploited. In this paper we utilize measurement of coherence and phase synchrony (Phase features) to inspect the activities of sensory motor cortex during imagination of hand and feet movement. An attempt is made to establish relationship between changes occurring in the motor cortex with respect to phase. After bandpass filtering and spatial filtering for noise removal analysis of phase characteristics of these signals is carried out. These features are classified with the help of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifiers. The classification performance suggests that phase and coherence features prove to be an additional set of features for differentiating between various motor imagery signals. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this type of wireless network, any node can leave or join network at any movement. Besides it this type of networks have some other challenging characteristics as regularly changing topology, high mobility, narrow bandwidth. Conventional routing protocols focused on finding shortest path rather than Quality of Service path. Link breakage is the main reason of high mobility as well as lack of energy of wireless nodes. In the lack of resources, traffic density leads to congestion. So, the performance of routing protocol degrades in this type of networks. But it is not so easy task to take multiple QoS parameters for finding optimal route. Mobile software agent technology with unique features like mobility, autonomous, intelligent and adaptability can solve this problem. This research paper focuses on designing routing model using mobile agent paradigm. The proposed model attempts to find more optimal path by considering multiple QoS parameters like stability, delay, congestion and energy of the node. Simulation is done using Matlab simulator the simulation output shows that our proposed model is more reliable than traditional hop by hop AODV for finding the route from source node to destination node. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

An evolutionary algorithm, inspired from intelligence of crow, named as Crow search algorithm (CSA) is implemented to achieve the optimal control parameter settings for optimal power flow in a existing power network. It is validated that CSA may promote to gain satisfactory outcomes compared to the other centralized technique: Particle swarm optimization (PSO) with promising convergence characteristics. Also, a comparative analysis of active power loss and operating cost has been shown in this article. The total performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through numbered mathematical strategies on IEEE 30-bus power network. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Two structures, planar (single gate) JLT in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) and double gate JLT (DG-JLT) are used for 2-D quantum transport simulation. Position of peak concentration of impurities has been varied across channel to get less leakage current, better sub-threshold swing. Reduced OFF current, subthreshold swing and High ON to OFF current ratio are achieved in JLT (Planar and double-gate structure) by tuning shape and peak of non-uniform doping profile. Peak concentration of impurities at the surfaces gives the better performance in terms of reduced OFF current, subthreshold swing and High ON to OFF current ratio. Moreover it is observed that multi-gate structure with nonuniform doping profile will give robust design compared to the single-gate structure with non-uniform doping profile. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This tool has been used for analysis of electrical characteristics of the VOTFT and thereafter its performance parameters have been extracted. The channel of the VTOTFT dictates the thickness of the organic srmiconductor materials (OSC) and further to enhance the performance of the device the noval dual gate architecture has been proposed. This architecture is used for enhancing and boosting the performance of OTFT. The results of analysis shows that the performance of dual gate VOTFT is much enhanced and gives a higher I                             <sub>on</sub>                             / I                             <sub>off</sub>                             ratio current.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Band notched characteristics of the scheduled antenna is obtained to prevent the potential interference between the ultra wideband transmission systems and the existing limited band transmission system. The scheduled antenna is fabricated on a FR-4 Epoxy substrate; and has compact size of dimensions 36 \u00d7 32 mm2. According to the measured and simulated results of scheduled antenna, antenna has impedance bandwidth of 2.3 to 15 GHz with VSWR \u2264 2. The proposed antenna is suitable for the Bluetooth (2.4GHz), WiMax(2.5/3.5GHz), WLAN(2.4/4.9/5.8-GHz, and Ku-band satellite communication. The proposed antenna has been fabricated and the measured result is found very close to simulated results.

One is reduced model of stable part and second one is unstable part of decomposition.

To meet the requirements of grid integration and for the proper functioning of the DG system, the appropriate control topology should be enhanced to offer seamless transition, safety, protection, voltage balance and frequency stability in grid coupled and islanding approach. Islanding is a very critical and unsafe condition for the utility workers and it may prevent automatic re-connection of devices. For that DG scheme have to identify the islanding condition and must exchange to a operating mode. Here, in the grid connected mode, the controller is operating in the current control mode to offer stipulated power to the grid but its inject large harmonics component into the grid. For that, a sliding mode control scheme is implemented instead of the current control scheme and compared to check the performance of the different control scheme on mode transition and total harmonic distortion of DG unit. The grid connected PV scheme is demonstrated in the MATLAB Simulink environment. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

As a large number of engineers are produced every year, but the productivity is not up to the mark. Therefore, leading to the unemployment of Engineering graduates, due to the lack of skills, interest, creativity, and hands-on-training exposure. This paper discusses in depth the challenges and improvement required in the existing curriculum of engineering to overcome the problem of unemployment in our country. Besides this, proposed syllabi of engineering also summarized in the paper to fulfill the existing gap that results in larger employment and industry-ready engineers. Additionally, it will be helpful in creating interdisciplinary co-relation between traditional and outcome-based engineering education for Indian Engineering Institutions and Universities. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Achievable throughput in cognitive radio-medium access control (CR-MAC) has direct impact on common control channel (CCC) design and control overhead. The CCC design decides the most efficient path to collision free data transmission for CR user. The in-band CCC design suffers with collision due to asynchronous control information transmission and multichannel hidden terminal due to clustering. To achieve global coverage dedicated out-band CCC is used but subjected to intruder attacks and saturation. In comparison with in-band, dedicate out-band overlay CCC design performs much better thus widely used in multi-channel environment. The need of common channel selection arises again whenever the primary user (PU) reappears in the channel. Spectrum hand-off is required to avoid collision between CR user and PU. To deal with the issue, the proactive switching is more favorable to reactive switching scheme. Capability of prediction of best future spectrum through past history of the channels makes network less prompt to the collision. The existing work shows that the new channel access for switching in proactive hand-off is works according to the environmental changes. The higher number of hand-offs increases packet loss which affects system performance drastically. To deal with stated issues, in the proposed work a common channel selection algorithm through transmission of PU free channel list (PCL) is developed. The history of same PCL is then used to develop a proactive hand-off scheme. The hand-off algorithm improves performance through best channel selection. It reduces the number of channel switching thus minimizing disruptions due to PU activities. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Internet of Things (IoT) will play a major role in the development of smart grid. The most of the countries giving thrust in incorporating the renewable generation for the purpose of getting clean energy. Mostly, the renewable generations are penetrating the low voltage side of the power system. This penetration is making the power distribution system a complex one. The power distribution system embedded with IoT can provide a solution to this complexity. But embedding the IoT into the power distribution system poses new challenges. This paper identifies these challenges in various interdisciplinary domains of the IoT power distribution system while surveying different latest literatures. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Usually, randomized deployment is done in hard to reach territories and manual deployment is done in easy to reach areas. This emerging technology has several applications however, it also has several issues viz., power efficiency, scalability, responsiveness, reliability and security etc. Wormhole attack is one of such issues related to network security. This attack is done at network layer. There are various modes of this attack. Among these modes, wormhole attack based on high transmission power is focused in this paper. Here, we proposed a scheme for detection of this type of wormhole attack by using Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the results of simulation are shown with various performance metrics. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The key idea of this article is implementing an automatic single axis solar tracking system. Alignment of solar panel with the Sunlight for getting maximum solar radiation is experimented. This system tracks the maximum intensity of light in terms of maximum power point (MPP). When the light intensity decreases, its alignment changed automatically for catching maximum light intensity. This article shows implementation and analysis of single axis solar tracker, while various solar axis trackers are available in the market. Meanwhile, the proposed technique is able to identify axis quickly and aligned with sun rays in order to achieve MPP as the output regardless motor speed. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

First order sliding mode control laws are derived in order to control the chaotic behaviour in FDFPS. The sufficient stability condition is devised for the designed sliding manifold based on Lyapunov stability theory. The proposed control law simplifies the controller design of power system stabilizer and provides an effective and robust control to avoid the instability in the FDFPS. Simulation is presented in MATLAB environment and reveals the effectiveness of proposed SMC scheme. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In today's scenario, SAR Interferometry (InSAR) is being used to measure the elevation and displacement of manmade and natural features. This study was focused on phase filtering to detect displacement in cultural heritage site using space borne repeat pass SAR Interferometry. Rohtasgarh fort, was chosen as study site and Sentinel -1, C-Band interferometric pairs of March and April 2017 were used. Interferometric processing for interferogram generation, coherence and phase unwrapping was performed to generate a displacement map. It was however noticed that phase noise greatly affects and deteriorates the quality of interferogram which in turn affects the phase unwrapping and geophysical measurements such as displacement mapping. In this work, Modified Goldstein filter was used for phase noise suppression and preserving the fringe edges. Using a threshold of 0.3 for coherence, displacement map was generated, and Modified Goldstein Filtering was applied on it. Most of the areas in and around the fort showed no displacement but there was an upliftment seen at few places inside the fort with maximum value of 10mm. Subsidence with maximum value of 10mm was also seen in areas outside the fort. Upliftment could have been due to water accumulation inside the fort or dust storm while subsidence could be possible due to lose debris washed off by rain water. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper presents a new approach combining clustering and scheduling algorithms, termed as Smart Home Load Manager (SHLM), for automatic scheduling of appliances considering Demand Response (DR). The clustering algorithm automatically calculates peak consumption hours of consumer, based on previous consumptions, using load index and cluster coefficient, whereas the scheduling algorithm schedules the interruptible loads based on appliance predefined priorities. The SHLM keeps operating load below power limit, especially during utility peak hours, considering various constraints like comfort, pricing signals and power outages to minimize Peak-to- Average Ratio (PAR). In addition, deployment of the proposed approach serves as a catalyst to promote DR potentials for the benefit of both end users and utilities. The effectiveness of the proposed approach and the practical application of DR signals are demonstrated on Virginia Tech Advanced Research Institute data. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Recipe recommendation literature typically considers either flavour or nutrient factor. Various flavour traits are also preventing the promotion of healthy foods while maintaining the palatability. Our data driven flavour and nutrient optimization framework consists of classification model which achieved 79.546 % prediction accuracy when detecting the cuisine, generalized flavour recommendation approach and personalized nutrient recommendation approach when deciding the optimization task. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

WSN is bringing attention from past few decades as it used in many geographical area and application. The usage of WSN have several benefits such as tiny size, low power, low cost and easy communication over small range. With these benefits it has certain drawbacks like low processing power, scarcity of storage and limited battery life. The biggest constraints of WSN is low battery powered and limited processing. The idea behind the integration of WSN and CC is to overcome the certain limitation of WSN and to exploit the cloud to share and process the sensory data such as temperature, pressure, light, movement etc. as collected by WSN anytime and anywhere. The proposed model deals with environmental application where detection of forest fire is analyzed by taking parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and time using fuzzy logic as by detecting earlier of fire in forest it helps to prevent huge loss of living organism, infrastructure and property. After detection the proposed MSA (Modified Sleep Awake) model work in prolonging lifetime of WSN in forest fire application using selective sleep awake approach. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In Grid connected renewable energy based EV charger systems, the bidirectional AC/DC converters are employed for more reliable power flow operation. This paper proposes a bidirectional AC/DC converter with combination of ac-dc grid bidirectional converter (GBC) and de-de bidirectional battery charger (BBC). The GBC converter facilitate the bidirectional power flow between the AC and DC grid, and BBC converter provides a bidirectional power flow between the energy storage system/EVs and the dc grid with isolation. To inject the power in to the grid a robust current control technique is required. A hysteresis based current control technique is used to inject current in to the grid. In AC-DC conversion, an asymmetric PWM strategy is proposed with minimum switching transitions. Simulations are performed using PSCAD tool to validate the proposed control algorithms. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Due to advancement in power semiconductor technology, the utilization of FACTS devices has become an efficient solution to overcome voltage instability in power system. The weak transmission lines which are prone to voltage collapse are identified using a line voltage stability index. The power blackouts arising from voltage instability can be avoided if identification of the weak area leading to voltage collapse can be identified at an early stage using voltage stability index (VSI). In this paper, a line voltage stability indicator, VSI - 2 is used to identify weak transmission lines in the system. In order to enhance the voltage stability of the system, FACTS devices, i.e., TCSC and STATCOM are placed in series and shunt with weak transmission lines.

The advantages of folding are reduction in number of arithmetic circuits such as adders and multipliers, time multiplexing of numerous algorithms onto a single arithmetic circuit resulting in low silicon area for integrated circuits and can be processed on single or multiple clocks. As the number of arithmetic circuits decrease, the number of registers increases, so register minimization technique is used. This technique enables to reduce the area required by memory along with the reduction in the number of memory units. The algorithm is coded in VHDL and implemented on Xilinx Virtex7 XC7VX330T. On comparing the device utilization of the following pairs of circuits, the percentage improvement of folded DFG over filter DFG is nearly 35%, register minimized folded DFG over filter DFG is nearly 23% and register minimized folded DFG over folded DFG is nearly 16%. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It utilizes an improved Widrow-Hoff based adaptive control algorithm to control the voltage source converter (VSC) for enhancing the power quality of the distribution system. The Widrow-Hoff method is used to revise two weights to appraise the load fundamental active component and the supply voltages. The PO algorithm is used to extract the peak power and to calculate the duty ratio of the boost converter. For fast dynamics response, the DC link voltage is held at a set value by PI controller and its output is considered as a loss component of the current, which represents the losses in the VSC. A constant learning rate is chosen for updating the weight of adaptive control, which shows the good dynamic response and the accuracy. The performance of the proposed system is validated through simulated and test results in various dynamic conditions. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Moreover organic electronics provides numerous advantages like flexibility of the substrate, low cost raw material, low cost fabrication, simple fabrication steps and flexible device. These advantages open a whole new world of low cost electronics display devices and much more. But the larger size of organic transistor and moderate mobility of organic materials serves as challenge for us. But a probable solution to these problems can be found in pass transistor logic (PTL) design. Since the overall size of the circuit also depends on the number of transistors in the circuit and not merely on the size of individual circuit. Therefore by drastically reducing the transistor count in the circuit we can minimize the size of the circuit. In addition to it the propagation delay and interconnect length is also optimised by using PTL architecture along with power dissipation. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Tracking the position of UEs while minimizing signalling cost is a key problem that needs to be solved for upcoming 5G networks. Tracking area (TA) is a term used for assemblage of cells (nodes) in long term evolution networks. Planned distribution of TAs, depending on the mobility pattern of UEs, is a technique used to optimize the signalling overhead, and plays a vital role in utilizing the resources efficiently. TAs must be reconfigured over the time intervals so as to adapt them to the variation in UE's pattern. Compared to earlier generations of cellular networks, 5G networks will have more flexible configuration of TAs as it will utilize the concept of tracking area list, given in 3GPP release 8. One of the objectives of 5G mobile network is to cope up with an ever-increasing number of UEs. This paper forms a basis for TA reconfiguration in 5G network using game theory, and finds an optimal solution for optimizing the signalling overhead of the network. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The introduced controller is articulated thru incorporating low pass filter with PID controller. The internal model control exploits to tune the parameter of MPID load frequency control. The wind power has increases its share in renewable energy sources and therefore, IMC-MPID load frequency controller demonstrates with wind power plant without frequency regulation capability and with inertial control. MATLAB/Simulink has employed for simulation. The frequency and tie line power deviation reduces for IMC-MPID load frequency controller for both cases. Hence, proposed controller has evidenced its aptness. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "                             IGBT switching and current control technique has been developed using VME system. This technique uses VME digital input and output (DIO) card, IP330 analog in (AI) module and VME interrupt programming. This technique has been successfully used in switching and current control of IGBT based power supply of Radial Control Coil (RCC) of SST-1. The gate pulse trigger interface is of TTL type. With IGBT driver circuit, VME DIO card and IP330 AI module can be used for hysteresis band control of IGBT power circuit. Time response of DIO card is analyzed in isolation and along with feedback processing and status monitoring. DIO card pulse trigger rise and fall time along with feedback processing have been analyzed in detail to ensure 10 kHz switching range of IGBT. DIO card used for switching of IGBT has a very low-rise time of 30 ns and fall time of 170 ns. It alone can provide very high switching at TTL voltage interface. With appropriate driver circuit interface, VME system can be used for switching and current control of any IGBT based power supply using hysteresis band control technique. Feedback current is acquired using IP330 analog in module. Reference current (Iref) is provided through FO link interface in digital format. IP330 acquires feedback (I                             <sub>fback</sub>                             ) signal at acquisition rate of 10kHz with external clock trigger. Interrupt base processing has been programmed in VME system. Interrupt is generated through IP330 module after acquisition of all converted channels. Combination of VME DIO and VME IP330 Analog In module a feedback current and switching techniques have been successfully developed. Time response of VME modules and interrupt programming, results of output voltage waveforms at RCC power supply and MATLAB simulation are presented in this paper.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The system consists of two transmitting elements and more than 3 receiving elements. The configuration of STBC in this paper is 2 \u00d7 3 or 2 \u00d7 4. STBC-OFDM symbol length is 32 ms with 512 sampling points. Under multipath condition without CP, Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) and Inter Carrier Interference (ICI) happens and causes severe communication performance degradation. In the proposed system, the ISI is removed by multiplying Left Null Space Vectors based on measured Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs) and the ICI is minimized by multiplying Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) weight. By increasing the number of receiving element (transducer), the Left Null Space Vectors can be obtained. To verify the ISI and ICI suppression performance, Matlab computer simulation is used. For 2 \u00d7 3 STBC-MIMO cases, roughly 150 (16QAM) and 190 (QAM) sampling points delayed multipath has been compensated successfully. For 2 \u00d7 4 STBC-MIMO cases, more than 250 (16QAM and QPSK) sampling points delayed multipath also compensated. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The most suitable waveform for high data rate communication can be GFDM. Its flexibility allows presence of CP-OFDM and equalization in single carrier frequency domain. In this paper, we analyze the important characteristics of GFDM and comparison of GFDM with OFDM, FBMC and UFMC. Motive of this paper is to come out with the most prominent and suitable multicarrier modulation waveform that can be used in 5G cellular network. Paper comprises of introduction to GFDM had proved to be the concept to spread the available spectrum for each user into multiple spectral segments, each of those segments having more or less bandwidth. After introducing GFDM, paper comprise of disadvantages of OFDM, FBMC and UFMC which made GFDM to be most suitable for 5G. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The high frequency transformer of the proposed converter is designed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to reduce input current THD (Total Harmonic Distortion) less than 5% and power factor close to unity. The main feature of the converter, is to emulate a resistive circuit to the supply mains to provide power factor correction (PFC). The speed of SRM is controlled by regulating two output voltages of the proposed converter over a wide range as the drive speed is considered here as a function of converter output voltage. Experimental results on a 200 W prototype of proposed converter fed SRM drive, are presented to verify the improved power quality operation of the proposed drive at different supply voltages and loading conditions. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Nevertheless certain shortcomings are faced such as adding in number of components and voltage balancing problem. In order to overcome these, a seven-level hybrid inverter has been proposed. This topology requires a lesser number of power switches which results in the decrease of multifaceted nature, add up to cost and weight of the inverter. Finally this can be able to generate near sinusoidal voltages and approximately fundamental frequency switching.

Actually since last two decade innovations and experiments have been increased in this field. Here various materials and design are used for calculation of dispersion, minimizing the loss, verifying the refractive index [13 14, 15] of the material used etc. Since Photonic crystal fibers [10]-[15] have various properties among them the above mentioned are widely used to calculate and measure in every design and structure. In this paper we tried to compare the above mentioned properties of various materials like the conventional material of PCF [10]-[11] is Silica Glass [1]-[2], borosilicate crown glass (BK7) [3], chalcogenide glass [4]-[5], Borofloat glass [6], GE 124 NSG OZ, Vycor [7]-[8] and Soda Lime [9]. Apart from the mentioned properties we have also considered some other physical and chemical properties of these materials. To compare all these properties of these materials we used to refer various articles and research papers then finally concluded that all the three material have their own merits and demerits and they shows their properties in best manner for the selected wavelength region. We have prepared various tables with the data collected and draw graphs between them to show the variation of these parameters for various material used. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper presents the voltage regulation of DC microgrid using a solar photovoltaic module, Li-ion Battery and AC grid as an input source. The outputs of these three inputs are interconnected with help of buffer circuit and are fed to dc bus. The voltage across DC bus is maintained to a certain desired value, which is being further regulated to four different lower voltages with help of buck converters. Buffer circuits are used to monitor the instantaneous power imbalance between source and load of the entire circuit. The boost converter is connected along the PV module and Li-ion battery respectively to regulate the output voltage of these sources to the desired value which is being fed to dc bus. The Maximum Power Point Tracking is also connected to the PV module which is essential to drive the system to the maximum power point to obtain the much efficiency. The system is modelled and simulated in the PSIM working environment. The dc bus voltage is also regulated to four different voltages levels so that the different dc household loads can be connected through it. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A comparison of the simulation output made between the results obtained by the proposed Harmony search method with that of Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm has been presented.

Various tapering schemes have been analysed in order to get wider device bandwidth along with appreciable gain. It has been found that increase in waveguide wall radius resulted in large output power and gain without significant alteration in mid-band frequency. The increase in disc-hole radius causes decrease in device bandwidth with rise in the gain of device. Further, combination of two tapering schemes, i.e., tapering the waveguide wall radius for the purpose of improving the gain and tapering the disc-hole radius for widebanding, has been investigated. It has been found that combined tapering scheme results in improvement of device gain and bandwidth. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The proposed algorithm is amalgamation of negative sequence component of current and Phase Angle Shift (PAS). The proposed protection algorithm is able to detect all the internal faults occurred in both the units (series unit and excitation unit) of an ISPST. The algorithm is also evaluated to detect minor Turn-to-Turn (TT) internal fault of 1% shorted winding. In addition to that effect of CT saturation during external fault has also been considered. The simulation of different fault conditions in an ISPST has been performed using PSCAD/EMTDC platform. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "With the increase of internet usage, most of the learners go for e-learning systems for all kinds of learning activities. E-learning has been able to provide support to all learners through a wide range of materials for every topic. But the availability of large materials and resources has caused difficulty in selecting the optimized material. The learners find it difficult to select the right resource based on their criteria for learning. Going through many resources on same topics lead to learners losing his interest or dropping the idea of learning online. Thus, a recommender system that will provide the users right and optimized path of learning is essential. The idea is to recommend a learner the material that will suit his/her style and will help him/her learn quickly in an optimized manner. This paper estimates the learning style, personality and the knowledge level of a learner in order to recommend the next topics he/she should learn. The results from all of these three questionnaires are put into an algorithm named as aggregation using intuitionistic fuzzy genetic algorithm. This gave us the aggregated values for each student and the next task of classifying a student is done using the KNN classifier. The classes to which a student could belong are termed as low, low-medium, medium, medium-high and high. These classes will group together students having nearly same aggregate values and with similar learning, personality and knowledge levels. This will in turn help us to provide the learners with the material that would suit them and help them to progress at a much better pace. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, nanocubes shape conducting artificial enzymes modified flexible electrochemical sensor was fabricated for simultaneous sensing of glycated hemoglobin and hemoglobin where percentage of glycated hemoglobin is proven gold biomarker for diabetes. The simultaneous electrochemical sensing of hemoglobin and glycated hemoglobin is achieved using conducting artificial enzymatic nanocube based flexible carbon paste aluminium foil. Here, conducting artificial enzymatic nanocubes are prepared by molecular imprinting technology which promoted the fast kinetics of redox process and low detection limit of both hemoglobin and glycated hemoglobin with linear response of concentrations. The characteristic well define symmetrical separate peaks for both hemoglobin and glycated hemoglobin was obtained in aqueous and human blood samples. This novel cheap flexible sensor with remarkable dual selectivity and sensitivity could be used to determine hemoglobin and glycated hemoglobin at ultra-trace level in diabetic patient blood sample with 0.07 \u03bcM and 0.09 \u03bcM detection limit. Thus proposed flexible sensor can be a smart wearable sensor for diabetic monitoring. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The results of the simulation evinces that the amplitudes and periods of AC yield voltage are very much controlled.

Meanwhile, increased number of distributed generations, controllable loads, and renewable energy sources in electrical system has threatened network flexibility, security and equipment performances. This paper proposed new methodology which deals with two main objectives. The first objective is proposed to improve the life of substation distribution transformer by controlling its inside heating. To obtain so, the loading in the transformer is controlled continuously and maintain below limit most of time. The second objective is to improve the average of the remaining cycles of battery in the gridable vehicles. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been used to carry out optimal power flow considering loss minimization and voltage deviation minimization in objective function. The test system is IEEE-33 bus system. The result shows enhancement of life of transformer and the battery of gridable vehicles with and without proposed methodology. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The work demonstrates how non linearity among the different classes of remote sensing data with uncertainty are handled with Noise classifier with entropy(fuzzy classifier) using composite kernel technique for land use/land cover maps generation. This study has incorporated the composition of two prominent kernels Spectral and Sigmoid Kernel. The performance of the classifier is evaluated in supervised mode and, the assessment of accuracy has been carried out using FERM (Fuzzy Error Matrix), SCM (Sub-pixel Confusion Uncertainty Matrix). The basic objective is to optimize the resolution parameter '(\u03b4', regularizing parameter 'v' and weight factor \u03bb for Composite Kernel based Noise clustering with entropy classifier (Composite-KNCWE) and analysis of the classified fraction images. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology has become an essential element for 4G/5G wireless communication systems to achieve the necessities of higher data rates and communication reliability. Radio frequency power amplifier (RFPA) is the critical source of power consumption in such systems and produces nonlinear distortion due to its saturation property. This nonlinearity impairment is required to be essentially compensated as it further degrades the block error rate (BLER), error vector magnitude (EVM) and throughput performance of the data transmission through the wireless communication system due to which the advantages of MIMO systems like diversity gain and multiplexing gain cannot be fully achieved. This paper analyzes the effect of RFPA nonlinearity compensation using digital predistortion (DPD) with different MIMO configurations for the propagation conditions in the urban cities having very high traffic using MIMO diversity scheme. The paper establishes that better data rates as well as reliable data communication is achieved with higher order MIMO configurations. Moreover, RFPA nonlinearity compensation provides 6 times improvement in BLER, 2.77 times in throughput and about 2 times improvement in EVM measurements with MIMO 4\u00d71 diversity at 15 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

First objective of this paper is to present the methodology for optimal placement of distributed generation (DG), that is, to determine the optimal number, the size, and location of the critical buses for placement of DG in distribution system in order to minimize the losses and also to ensure acceptable voltage profile. Therefore initially, critical buses (violating the specified criterion) are recognized by carrying out the analysis of power flow without DG placement in the benchmark system. Load flow analysis is then performed after placement of DG to observe the effect DG has on voltage profile and losses of the system. Further, the second objective of this paper is to propose the methodology for optimal placement of capacitors to reduce the power loss in the network and to ensure acceptable voltage profile. IEEE-13 node benchmark distribution system is used for carrying out the analysis using the above mentioned methodologies. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

ERPs have excellent temporal resolution therefore, it is considered as an accurate measure for the cognitive research. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique and is most widely used to measure ERPs. The aim of this paper is to measure the ERPs in the cognitive task and detects or determines some of the components of ERPs. One of the ERP components which are found here is P300. P300 was elicited with auditory stimulus. The auditory stimulus was designed according to the oddball paradigm in which the participant detects a less frequent 'target' stimulus in a regular series of standard stimuli. This stimulus consists of series of alphabets and digits in which only digit is the target. Two age group people (20\u00b15 years and 40\u00b15 years) participated in this experiment. Then, P300 latency and amplitude are compared between these two age groups. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper we attempted to solve algorithmic defects and use more validation measures to show the strength of our proposed algorithm. The main purpose of this clustering algorithm is to provide a better clustering quality and higher accuracy utilizing intersection points. To validate our clustering algorithm, we have performed several experiments with benchmark datasets. Besides our proposed algorithm, five well-known agglomerative clustering algorithms are also used. Purity as an external criterion is used to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms. Compactness of each cluster derived by clustering algorithms is also calculated to evaluate the validity of clustering algorithms. Eventually, the results of experiments show that in most cases the error rate of our proposed algorithm is lower than other clustering algorithms which are used in this study. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper studies the impacts of distributed solar PV penetration in a low-voltage unbalanced distribution network of Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IITGN). The distribution network under study has total connected load around 2 MW with total solar PV penetration of 500 kWp in form of roof-top and ground mounted (solar carport). The quasi-static load flow study has been performed, considering one-hour resolution load power and distributed generation power data. Simulation results are discussed with respect to the bus voltage profile, active power injection at load bus, line losses, and source power factor with and without the solar PV injection. It is found that there is no reverse power flow at main feeder and voltage quality issue associated with this network. The analysis also hints at reduction in active power losses in the line due to SPV injection at the consumer location. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Inhomogeneous insolation on a solar PV plant due to cloud, nearby construction, tree branches etc. reduces its power output significantly. Further, multiple peaks in power-voltage characteristics of the PV array are also observed due to partial shading, which calls for sophisticated and costly MPPT controller to make the the array operate at its global MPP. However, the enhancement in array output using global MPP is also limited by the array interconnections. This leaves scope for further improvement in array power output. In this work, a voltage balancing technique using DC-DC converters is developed to improve the array power output during partial shading. The results of simulation carried out to validate the proposed method for different shading level and pattern show its effectiveness in improving the power output. In addition, a case study on constant power load (CPL) using a PV-battery system demonstrates that the proposed strategy can also double as a demand-response controller for a PV array to feed CPL. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The traditional approach of kinematic analysis is not suitable for parallel manipulator. Therefore, the inverse kinematic approach is used for the workspace analysis. A simplified equation for tracing the boundary of the workspace is presented. Practically, the manipulator stops or fails to operate after traveling certain distance within the workspace due to the occurrence of singularity, therefore singularity must be avoided for a smooth operation of manipulator. In the present paper, the mathematical conditions for the three kinds of singularity of five-bar planar parallel manipulator are derived, which is based on Jacobian matrices and represent the corresponding singularity configuration. The results are useful to the design, manufacturing and control of a five-bar planar parallel manipulator. This kind of analysis is very important while designing the industrial robotic manipulator. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

There are several factors which are responsible for the thermal losses such as material properties, the magnitude of current, contact resistance and topological aspects etc. The objective of this study is to optimize the design parameters of novel distribution box and enhance its overall performance using the statistical method- Taguchi optimization technique and compared with the design parameters obtained using a computational algorithm.

The comparison of the closed loop performance of the said approaches is expected to help the step of Model in Loop validation of control software development. This could ease and speed up its implementation on the embedded hardware that serves as integral part of induction motor drive. The work develops a Linear Time Variant state space model for a squirrel cage induction motor of known electrical equivalent circuit parameters using fundamental equations. The IMPC and EMPC controller actions are computed by constructing and solving optimization problems using Quadratic Programming approach and multi-parametric PWA solver approach respectively. The tracking performance for speed set point trajectory and the rejection of disturbance torque acting on the shaft are simulated and compared along with the trade-offs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

There are two configurations presented in the paper namely, Zero-V                             <sub>GS</sub>                              load logic (ZVLL) and diode load logic (DLL). The performance is analyzed using three parameters -voltage gain, voltage transfer characteristics and dynamic response. This is an effective technique to overcome the threshold voltage drop in digital logic circuits. Comparison among these reveals that DLL configuration gives better dynamic results as compared to the ZVLL inverter. The paper concludes with the implementation of future issues to minimize the propagation delay and improve the noise margin. The comparison of performance in terms of static and dynamic responses of these three techniques is also dealt with.                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The secondary objective of this modified Firefly Algorithm was to consider all parameters namely \u03b1, \u03b2,\u03b3 to be adaptive in accordance to the objective function. No a-priori knowledge of the problem domain is required, as such; no preset or tuning of the said parameters is required beforehand. A failsafe criterion for clearance of local minima is also applied. The tendency of standard Firefly algorithm to get stuck in local minima and slow convergence is mitigated by applying reverse ellitism in RE-FA. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Passive correlators with maximal length sequence periods of 7 and 15 are fabricated and tested on 128\u00b0 Y-cut bulk Lithium Niobate. The input transducer is modulated at carrier frequencies of 470-930 MHz with a chip duration of 100 n s. At the output, a maximum peak-to-sidelobe ratio of 15 dB is measured. The same design is then fabricated in GaN on sapphire in order to incorporate acoustoelectric gain sections using an AlGaN barrier engineered to ensure low sheet density. We consider a basic cell consisting of a tap followed by a gain section to support long correlator structures. This represents a first step towards mitigating acoustic propagation losses in monolithic GaN SAW correlators. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This type of antenna consists of three U slots and one I slot into the radiation patch and feedline and ground plane is defected by placing two inverted U shaped slots into it. By cutting these slots, multi band notched properties in the WiMAX band (3.5 / 5.5 GHz), C band (4 GHz), WLAN band (5.2 / 5.8 GHz), National Information Infrastructure band (U-NII) (5.15 / 5.825 GHz), RFID band (6.6 / 7.1 GHz) and ITU uplink satellite communication band (8.1 / 8.4 GHz) are obtained. This compact antenna has an appropriate size of 16.5\u221716.5 mm2 and has UWB applications in X band (8 / 12 GHz), upper S band (2 / 4 GHz) and operates from 3.2973 to 11.9310 GHz frequency range. After doing the simulation on HFSS software, we get improved return loss, antenna efficiency, VSWR, antenna gain and radiation patterns. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Trust management is one of the effective methods to defend against threats posed to WSN. The trust management system helps to mitigate many insider attacks and malicious behaviour of nodes. In this paper, we proposed a robust trust model that prevents various attacks viz; bad mouthing, self-promoting and collusion attacks. It uses the time lapses function based on forgetting curve to calculate direct trust and reputation function for indirect trust. Our proposed trust model is scalable. When the trust value is above the threshold value, then we consider a communication link as active and node is trusted, otherwise we remove the communication link and mark the node as malicious. The simulation results indicate the effectiveness of proposed method and maximizes the defence against the internal attacks. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Till date conventional vision based gesture recognition has had poor success rate since hand engineered features failed to communicate the gesture semantics unambiguously, especially when the gesture is dynamic in nature. This research proposes a deep convolutional neural network based technique that is able to estimate the command direction represented by a finger pointing gesture, with a considerably high accuracy. Moreover, the proposed architecture is able to estimate the direction of finger pointing using only a single two-dimensional RGB image of the hand gesture without using any depth information or stereo-vision techniques making the system computationally and physically less expensive which is particularly suitable for the real time applications such as communicating with the humanoid robots in a home environment. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Ansys HFSS simulations are used to explain the design methodology of the proposed antenna, by studying its impedance bandwidth, mutual coupling, simulated 3D radiation patterns as well as surface current distribution features. The proposed MIMO antenna exhibits excellent diversity performance (ECC < 0.1) and MEG-ratio within \u00b13 dB in uniform propagation scenario. The robustness of the proposed MIMO antenna is further checked for indoor Gaussian / Uniform propagation environment for a wide- range of scenario parameters. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Human eyes are capable to differentiate approximate 10 million colors. It contains more than 2 million tissues and cells. Therefore human eyes are known as a prominent sense organ but sometimes it get confused to identify the things which are approximately similar in appearance but actually different. One of the common example is differentiating the Azadirachta indicaneem (Neem) tree and Melia azedarach (Bakain) tree leaves. As bakain tree is slightly harmful if consumed thus it is essential to distinguish between these two leaves. Therefore, an automated approach have been proposed to distinguish between neem tree leaves and bakain tree leaves with the help of texture features of the leaves and then classifying them in different categories by using machine learning. The performance of proposed approach by using tree classifier is 99.8%, which is found better with respect to the other classifiers like k-NN, SVM, etc. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The identification of P-wave and T-wave is carried out by a simple search forward and backward procedure. The algorithm has been tested on several ECG data available on online database i.e. PhysioNet with sampling frequency ranging from 128Hz-1 KHz. The accuracy of this technique has been determined on the results obtained by two statistical parameters i.e.; Positive Predictivity (+P) and sensitivity(SE). \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The device is biased in the saturation region of operation with the gate shorted to the source and is studied under different radiation flux densities. Both the illumination models exhibit significantly high UV response with the front-illuminated OPFET showing superior performance at the lower flux densities whereas the back-illuminated model showing better response at the higher flux density with a compromise in the bandwidth. The results demonstrate that the devices under study exhibit greater performance potential than many of the photo detectors reported in the literature under review.

In D2D communication, two nearby mobile users establishes the direct link for communication without involving the network infrastructure. A wireless communication with high data rate increases the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. To resolve these issues, the D2D communication underlaid cellular network over Nakagami-m fading has been proposed in this paper. In underlaid in-band D2D communication, the licensed frequency bands of cellular network are reused by D2D communication. This introduces additional interference that affect the quality of service but increases the spectral efficiency with low power consumption. The D2D users transmit to their paired receiver by reusing the uplink resource of the cellular network. Average sum rate (ASR) and energy efficiency (EE) have been analyzed for D2D communication underlaid cellular networks. The poisson point process (PPP) and stochastic geometry have been utilized to characterize the random distribution of user equipment. The expressions derived for ASR and EE show the variation over cellular to BS distance, D2D pair distance, and Nakagami fading parameter. The results from this analysis provide a desirable system design parameters that offer the best gains in terms of ASR and EE. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In order to know the quality of the blurred image automatically and accurately, a no-reference method is proposed in this paper. The proposed method is based on the fact that if the image that is to be assessed is blurred intentionally, the effect on its structure will vary for different blurriness levels. The structure of image having no traces of blur is altered much more on deliberate blurring than the image which is highly blurred. To measure this structural change, SSIM is employed which gives the structural similarity of the image before and after willful blurring. The structural similarity value so obtained is trained and tested against the ground truth of the image by a machine learning regression algorithm. The proposed method is highly accurate giving Pearson linear correlation coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) value of 0.99 and 0.97 respectively. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The circuits have been designed and simulated using UMC180 technology file in cadence virtuoso environment with a power supply voltage of \u00b10.9V. It has been found that the proposed circuits consume power of 11.33 microwatts, and show linearity range of \u00b10.4V and \u00b10.75V for bias offset and floating gate bias offset OTAs respectively. Also, the open loop gain is 64dB and 56dB respectively. These techniques results in Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of -35dB and -45dB for bias offset and floating gate bias offset OTAs respectively at 0.4Vpp input voltage. These results have also been compared and contrasted with the available state-of-art. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, an optimized SHE-PWM technique is presented for the calculation of switching angles and control of a 7-level inverter. In most of the literature, triplen harmonics are not considered for calculation of angles as they are absent in line voltage, but they are present in phase voltage and in very high magnitude.

        "abstract": "In this paper, the state-feedback controller is designed for continuous time systems subjected to fast-varying delay and actuator saturation. A new integral inequality called Wirtinger's inequality is considered to derive the stability conditions, which is proved as less conservative in comparison to well-known Jensen's inequality. The Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed on the basis of above inequality. Then, an improved reciprocally convex approach is applied to reduce the conservatism. The behavior of saturation nonlinearity is represented by convex hull approach. A delay-dependent stability condition is obtained for synthesis of such controller in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). An optimization setup is also defined in order to maximize the estimated domain of attraction. The efficacy of the proposed result is embellished by numerical example. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "A Recommendation System (RS) facilitates customers to purchase items of their choice. A user prefers to get relevant suggestions of his choice. Since, the acceptance of recommendation makes satisfaction to user and it increases the profits of website owner. Therefore, RS has become an important component of e-commerce websites now days. Normally, users give reviews of items as feedback on e-commerce websites. These reviews provide meaningful information about items for other users. The other users use these reviews to decide what he may like from the available options of items. Therefore., Recommender systems (RSs) of e-commerce website largely use the information available in online reviews given by users to generate the recommendations. However., in the influence of social events and latest trends of items., the acceptance of recommended items does not achieve an expected level of satisfaction in user, in spite of inclusion of customer review in computation of recommendation. This paper introduces an innovative approach in RS that uses the information of social events in the computation of recommendations. The approach uses content analysis on online news of social events. The supervised learning method is used in content analysis. The content analysis has two phases namely., news filtration and categorization computation. In news filtration., news is filtered based on their content which may influence the choice of user. The filtered news is then categorized using five-dimensional Human Cognitive System (HCS). The paper has discussed the computation of recommendation using the content analysis of online news using HCS and natural language processing (NLP) on review of products. The final computation of recommendation has enhanced the acceptability by user. It is shown with the help of confusion matrix. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The physiological responses to TTH based stress may differ with regards to acute and chronic stress. Stress related disorders are often termed as 'psychosomatic' disorders which involves the mind and body. These are the disorders in which the mind makes the body vulnerable for disorders. Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common and main diseases in psychosomatic medicine because of its correlation with psychosocial factors. Main life events such as divorce, surgery and loss of close relatives, family members inculcate major negative effects. Such events in the previous year have been considerably related to the persistence of headache. Present Paper is an effort to scientifically analyze the two popular biofeedback therapies-EMG and GSR on visual modes both in a clinical experimental environment for the treatment of TTH in the experiment period of 12 months. Authors have tried best to verify the hypothesis and establish the fact that is which kind of therapy is more useful through comparison between both therapies in audio, visual and audio visual modes as well as comparison among EMGa, EMGv and EMGav modes. The Study protocols have been registered with Clinical Trials Registry with ref. No. REF/2018/06/020361 of India affiliated to national institute of Medical Statistics, authoritative body of Indian Council of Medical Research. The dataset and obtained results are under process of registration. The Related project is also under process with DST -Ministry of Health to better deal with the TTH issue for public welfare. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This paper presents a high frequency transient based scheme for fault section identification on TCSC transmission line. The fault current signals are decomposed by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to obtain detail coefficients to detect faulty section. Further a new compensated Mho relay algorithm with adaptive property is proposed to protect the TCSC line. In this scheme Mho relay compensates the impedance, inserted by the TCSC in fault loop. The constancy of the proposed adaptive algorithm is tested for different relaying conditions such as: types of faults considering wide variations in compensation level, fault resistances, inception angle, fault distance from sending end and loading levels. Extensive simulation studies indicate that the proposed relay does not show any reaching mal-operation so it is reliable, accurate and secure. Assumed test system have been simulated in PSCAD/EMTDC and generated data have used for fault section identification by a MATLAB program. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The maximum power extraction from a PV array, reactive power compensation, harmonics mitigation, balancing of grid currents and seamless transition from grid connected (GC) mode to standalone (SA) mode and vice versa, are performed in this system. Whenever, the grid fails, this system operates in SA mode automatically thereby without causing any interruption in supplying the load. Similarly, it automatically shifts to the GC mode when the grid is restored. The VSC functions in current control mode (CCM) for GC mode and it operates in voltage control mode (VCM) for SA mode of operation. This system is capable of extracting the maximum power from the solar PV array irrespective it is operating in the GC mode or in SA mode of operation. The charging and discharging of the battery, are controlled by employing a bidirectional DC-DC converter (BDDC). It regulates the DC link voltage to the maximum power point (MPP) voltage of the PV array. If the absence of battery is detected, then the control is automatically shifted to VSC for performing the extraction of maximum power of PV array. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The FOPID controller has been proved superior to the Integer Order PID (IOPID) controller in several aspects which has led to its application in various nonlinear systems. This work demonstrates the design of a 2-Degree of Freedom (DOF) FOPID controller for a magnetic levitation (maglev) plant, which is a nonlinear and unstable system. The controller parameters are tuned using Symbiotic Organisms Search (SOS), which is a recent and efficient evolutionary algorithm, to achieve better system performance, in both time and frequency domain. To determine the efficacy of the controller, it's performance is compared with 1-DOF FOPID controller. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In recent time, the Software defined networking has become quite popular. OpenFlow protocol separates the network control from forwarding devices so it offers flexible and expansible functionality for networks. A large number of modules or applications has been developed for the SDN controller to fully utilize the flexibility and scalability of Software defined networking over traditional networking. Load balancing is one of the applications that is implemented in SDN. To balance the load on any node system needs to be sure that the destination node should be trusted. In case of load balancing, a node can also be labeled as trusted or not trusted when certifying migration request [24] [28]. This type of implementation can be implemented by SDN properties. As the applications increases day by day, communication between controller and the switches are also getting increased. Number of packets transmitting between the controller and switches increases as the number of applications are increased in the controller. In congestion control module the controller has to update itself very frequently by sending and receiving query response packets to get updated about the congestion state of switches. In this paper a congestion detection module has been modeled so that packet transmission between controller and switch can be reduce. This proposed method is executed on mininet and floodlight controller and analyze how to reduce those packets and provide the bandwidth of link between controller and switch to other applications. Results show that bandwidth utilize by the congestion control module is getting low. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, incorporating Distributed Generation (DG) brings in various technical challenges in power quality like harmonics, flickers, voltage swells, voltage sags etc. Integration of DG also calls for stability related issues, like voltage stability, transient stability and small signal stability mainly with respect to the penetration level. Presence of the DG changes the protection philosophies existing in the distribution system, hence, strategies need to be explored for safe islanding and adaptive relay setting. Harmonics and flicker affect the quality of power received at consumers' end while blinding of protection, islanding and false tripping affect the reliability of the system. For successful integration of DGs in the existing system, these issues need to be addressed. This paper highlights these key issues and challenges in the integration of DG system and explores the control techniques. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The reversible property is the most important feature of chalcogenide thin films for memory applications. This paper reviews the deposition techniques of chalcogenide thin films, depth discussion of their structural properties and applications in electronics and optoelectronic devices. Subsequently, the advantages and limitations of chalcogenide glasses are also discussed. Besides this, future research scopes in this domain are included in this paper to provide the line of sight for beginners of this research field. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This is due to several inherent advantages of MLI over two-level inverters such as high-quality output, lower device ratings, and several others. In this paper, a new cascaded MLI topology is proposed. The proposed topology not only reduces the number of isolated DC voltage sources, IGBTs and Diodes but also keeps the voltage stress, which is an imperative factor in influencing the cost of the inverter, across each switching device to a low and constant value with the increase in number of levels of the inverter. The proposed topology has also got redundant switching states which are useful for keeping equal power balance among the cells. The validation of the proposed MLI is substantiated with both computer simulations using MATLAB/SIMULINK software and by developing the laboratory prototype for a 7-level inverter. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The EMD algorithm works on the principle of time scale variations between the upper maximum values and lower minimum values of a waveform, and for a long time it has been considered as a good offline analysis approach. This paper studies the online frequency tracking ability of EMD with Hilbert Transform and brings forth the limitation of the Fourier Transform, S Transform and Hilbert Transform as frequency estimators. Here a signal section between two zero crossing is subjected to EMD which segregates the oscillating modes of the signal. Further, fundamental oscillating mode is identified and subjected to Hilbert Transform for frequency estimation. The identification of the fundamental component is done by evaluating a correlation parameter between each of the obtained oscillating components and the original section of the signal. The paper also investigates the effect the sampling frequency has on the efficiency of the algorithm. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In the past visible light face recognition has been considered as an authentic biometric trait and a lot of research has been done for performance enhancement of the same. But the impact of illumination variation over the recognition performance has been a challenging task to overcome when we take outdoor conditions into consideration whereas thermal infrared features are robust to the illumination variations as it focus on changes of temperature distribution on facial muscles and blood vessels. These temperature variations in itself creates a texture. The other major reason for the need of thermal trait is the night time surveillance when there is low or minimal amount of light thus is unable to illuminate the face. Thermal facial images is majorly used in several military operations as covert data acquisition carry challenges in its own ways and the visible light images sometimes fail miserably to fulfil the desired outcome due to its dependence on lighting and illumination variations. In this work we have done a comparative study on the performance of different handcrafted descriptors over thermal and visible images using different distance measures. The paper divides the proposed descriptors in 2 different sets i.e. lower order derivative based and higher order derivative based descriptors. We have compared the performance of different lower order derivative based descriptors over the higher order derivative based on different distance measures and tried to analyze the limitations and delimitations of handcrafted descriptors over multispectral range of images. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It is, therefore, necessary to further optimize the device performance at different doping levels. Here, the effect of variation in channel and substrate doping concentration has been investigated for the first time in the design of TMG Re-S/D FDSOI MOSFET. The performance parameters like threshold voltage, Ion/Ioff, transconductance, Drain Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL), and subthreshold slope have been taken under study. The device has been designed and simulated using device simulation software-Silvaco ATLAS TCAD tool. The random dopant fluctuation (RDF) is found to be reduced by optimizing the doping of substrate region. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

One such key periodicity is three base periodicity (period-3 behavior) which is mostly observed in protein coding regions of DNA signals and therefore it is widely used in protein coding region finding applications. Spectral analysis using narrowband pass filters has already been used for this purpose but the existing background noise of DNA signals limit the performance of these techniques. So far, a number of de-noising techniques have been used to reduce the effect of this noise. This paper emphasizes the effectiveness of singular value decomposition (SVD) as a de-noising filter for removal of background noise. The results are compared with the conventional moving average filter. The results obtained by SVD method demonstrate that the SVD method gives better de-noising performance than moving average filter and hence improve the prediction accuracy of exon prediction significantly. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A novel single phase hybrid MLI has been developed using minimum number of power electronics components. A unique feature of proposed topology is that it can be generalized up to n-levels also few discus parallel connection of MLI inverter in grid tied system. In order to generate gate pulses a level-shifted Pulse Width Modulation (LSPWM) technique has been proposed in this work. The optimum MLI structure is well applicable for medium and high voltage applications respectively. The experimental results are also presented here for the verification of the simulation results of MLI implemented using real-time simulator (dSPACE 1103) and harmonic spectrum of the inverter voltage using Fluke-434 power analyzer at different modulation indexes. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

So, change in capacity loss must be regulated at desired rate along with energy to be stored on battery. In this paper, real time receding horizon control scheme is suggested to predict optimal charging/discharging operations of battery energy storage system (BESS) for the future time horizon. In this control scheme, the BESS is to maintain desired rate of change of capacity loss and to store desired energy during all prediction horizon. A performance index based on error dynamics is proposed in receding horizon control scheme and optimal feedback control actions are generated to minimize the performance index for whole prediction horizons. The effectiveness of proposed scheme is tested on data available of assumed microgrid. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

WSN faces many challenges and limitations in term of processing, storage, memory, scalability, security, availability etc. To resolve such issues, Sensor Cloud (SC) has become part of today's research. Sensor cloud is the integration of WSN with cloud computing. It offers multiple applications running on each sensor node concurrently with the help of virtualization. In this way, sensor resources are shared to execute multiple applications at the same time. If we want to know the status of a particular position of a node in traditional WSN then one has to consider the positions of all nodes which is a time consuming process. Virtualization helps to minimize the time in such case. There are several such benefits of using sensor cloud which are described in this paper. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

MANET is a distributed, decentralized, dynamic network with no fixed infrastructure, which are self- organized and self-managed. Achieving high security level is a major challenge in case of MANET. Layered architecture is one of the ways for handling security challenges, which enables collection and analysis of data from different security dimensions. This work proposes a novel multi-layered outlier detection algorithm using hierarchical similarity metric with hierarchical categorized data. Network performance with and without the presence of outlier is evaluated for different quality-of-service parameters like percentage of APDR and AT for small (100 to 200 nodes), medium (200 to 1000 nodes) and large (1000 to 3000 nodes) scale networks. For a network with and without outliers minimum improvements observed are 9.1 % and 0.61 % for APDR and AT respectively while the maximum improvements of 22.1 % and 104.1 %. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Among various induction machine faults, failure of the bearing is considered as the leading cause of the shutdown of the industries and accounted approximately 41%. It is characterized by persisting of vibration signal which is usually very low in amplitude and associated with frequencies. An investigation has been carried out on enhancing the diagnostic relevance of vibration measurement using the identification of representative features and classification of damage, the location of damage and severity of damage. To fulfill the purpose, a hybrid feature pool has been prepared using calculated features from time, frequency, and time-frequency domain. In feature pool, there are total forty-six features which have been calculated and the optimal features have been selected using principal component analysis (PCA) and minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) from feature pool. The representative features are input to the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) Classifier. The performance of classifier has been compared. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The effect of various disc-parameters like radius of disc-hole, periodicity of disc and thickness of disc on the gain-frequency response and longitudinal power growth along the interaction structure have been studied and it has been concluded that the radius of disc-hole is more powerful parameter in governing the device gain. On the other hand, the disc-periodicity plays a vital role in controlling the device bandwidth. In order to get highest bandwidth or gain without altering the center frequency (91.4 GHz), the device parameters have been optimized. It has been found that the bandwidth and growth of gyro- TWT are high for rD/rW=0.6,\\ L/rW=0.4 and T/rW=0.1. With these parameters, the disc-loaded gyro- TWT has yielded in saturated output power 258 kW, 15.36 dB gain, 14.87% bandwidth, and the device efficiency 10%. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Surface plasmon (SP) amplification is caused by incorporating critical optical gain (g) in the nanoshell core, which leads to the amplification characteristics with lower threshold value for lasing action/process. We report that, the critical optical gain requirement in ZrN is comparable to Au based core-shell nanopartcle. The properties of SPASER and switch able nano scatterer are analyzed using quasistatic approximation (valid for small size particles). By introduction of specific gain in the core medium, the drastic change of scattering efficiency (Qsca) from ultra high to ultra low value and negative absorption cross-section is reported. The feasibility of TMNs as gain assisted surface plasmon amplification properties for various applications like plasmonic laser and nano scatterer is assessed and comparison is made with the most popular plasmonic material, namely Au. Present study can led to the realization of efficient SPASER structures/devices based on TMNs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Agriculture is one of the major sources of the economy for the people of India. The continuous demand for quality foods forces for innovation in food production technology as greenhouse farm. Food production mainly depends on weather condition and agriculture methods. The uncertainty nature of weather makes agriculture difficult for good crop cultivation. The scarcity of rainfall forces farmer to uses continuous other sources of water (tube-well, water pump) for crop cultivation. The crop production is based on temperature, humidity and soil moisture as a parameter for the production of the crop. The paper proposes a fuzzy based system leading to smart farming for effective growth of agriculture in India. The objective of model is used to monitor farm for efficient utilization of water. The proposed model shows the significant utilization of water in irrigation and is beneficial for the limited water area. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In the analysis of the analog and RF performance of the proposed structures, it is observed that transconductance (gm), cut off frequency (fT), transconductance frequency product (TFP) is improved by using gate stack while with the use of both gate and Box stacking its RF performance degraded. For high frequency application, stacking anywhere other than gate insulator will lead to degraded performance of the device.

        "abstract": "Lebanon is one of the countries in the Middle East that are endowed with climatic conditions which are predominantly sunny and characterized by hot summers and mild winters. The principal electric power producer in Lebanon (Electricit\u00e9 du Liban, EDL) is suffering from heavy financial losses spinning out of control from year to year. In addition, the different technical problems are affecting the electricity generation, its quality and the reliability of the power grid. This shortage in the generation of electricity was increased by the absence of any investments in new power plants since 1996 and the increased demand on power which was approximated by the World Bank as being a yearly increase of 8%. The customer in Lebanon has to subscribe with small power producers (private generators) which are currently illegal in order to complement the energy provided by EDL. To help solve this problem, the usage of renewable energy is suggested in this paper as an alternative to the non-environmental non-economic private generators at the short term and to complement the shortages of power provided by EDL. More importantly, the long-term motivation is the implementation of an environmentally-conscious energy approach that aspires to zero-carbon footprints in our country. The main purpose of this work is to develop a unified platform for the national geographical availability of renewable energy and to provide end users with all needed technical data and installation guidelines for the deployment of solar technologies in their homes, buildings, or residential areas. Practical sizing and most efficient installation of the renewable energy source or combination of sources that are most convenient to the end user are made available depending on the geographical location in Lebanon, the grid connectivity and the space availability. The end user will be fully aware of the different technical, economic, environmental and cultural advantages of renewable energy sources. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Many demand response programs (DRP) are used for this purpose. The thermostatically controlled load (TCL) are the most efficient programs used for DSM and especially for ancillary services. In this work, we study the heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) system as one of appliances that fall under the category of TCL. In literature, the chiller power variation due to direct control of HVAC supply fan speed is not considered for DSM. This paper fills this gap and increases the participation capacity of HVAC. Therefore, the HVAC system is remodeled in order to express with more accuracy the chiller power variation. The new model relates the chilled water temperature to the leaving air temperature. Simulation results shows the improvement provided by this method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

SCN is a generalization of Content-Centric Networking (CCN) where location-independent content objects are requested directly by name (contrary to IP connection-based model). However, CCN-like architectures are tailored to deliver content which is \"immediately\" available and therefore do not deal well with eventually-available service responses. That is why deploying time-intense services on CCN is a challenge.In this paper we take a glance at result delivery of long-lasting computations in CCN. We survey existing ideas to deal with delivery timeouts of eventually-available data and also introduce new solutions. Some of the approaches only affect the logic on the producers and consumers while others touch the core network forwarding logic. We discuss pros/cons of the solutions and report on running prototypes of all described ideas. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Since the lack of cellular connectivity is mostly experienced in rural zones, it is of mandatory importance to design solutions to manage cellular architectures tailored to such zones. To this aim, we consider a new cellular 5G architecture, where the Base Stations (BSs) are carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Specifically, we focus on the problem of planning the missions of the UAV-based BSs over the territory, with the goal of minimizing the energy consumed for moving the UAVs. After introducing the considered framework, which is based on a multi-period graph defined over a set of places and a set of Time Slots (TSs), we derive a simple algorithm, called GAUP, to solve the considered problem in a reasonable amount of time. Our results, obtained over a simple - yet representative - scenario, reveals that GAUP is able to efficiently manage the energy for moving the UAVs, while guaranteeing relatively low computation times. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In fact, the battery power profile is not constant; it varies depending on the energy present in the battery. When the State Of Charge of the battery is low, the charging power profile has the highest value. It starts to decline when the battery is approaching its full energy capacity. The consideration of a constant battery power profile may create inaccuracy in the optimization results and lead to eventual instability on the distribution network. Therefore, in this paper, we are going to study the impact of considering or not considering the variable battery power profile on the distribution network and on the end-user financial profits. Simulations are done with OpenDSS and MATLAB using IEEE 13 distribution test feeder. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The paper investigates thoroughly the hybridization requirements in such areas. A detailed study is carried out to improve a typical existing hybrid solar-wind-DG system already implemented and supplying a base station located in the Chouf region-Lebanon. The system is designed and simulated under HOMER software program, which is used to test its performance technically and financially.

In order to promote energy policies able to improve the solar energy potential use, it is necessary to set up multi-criteria approaches for producing improved diagnostic analysis. This study, conducted in eight mountain huts located in the Beaufortain region, in French Alps, shows the advantages and limitations of these approaches. Even if analysis criteria can be easily identified, the search for data allowing an accurate assessment is often difficult for isolated mountain dwellings. The results of this original study show the importance of multi-criteria analysis for technical and architectural issues linked to solar energy integration in isolated mountain dwellings by taking into account their natural environment, the elements of their bioclimatic architecture, their solar production conditions and their energy needs. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It is carried out using an algorithm based on ordinal optimization (OO) for sizing and dynamic programming (DP) for operation. DP is used to simulate and find the optimal operation strategy of the system for a given set of different system components' sizes and loads. OO is an efficient method to search the design space and assess alternative designs and rank them initially using a simple model. The top-S designs are then identified and re-assessed using an accurate model to obtain a set of \u00bbgood enough\u00bb solutions from which the best, with a given alignment probability, is identified. A system composed of a photo-voltaic (PV) generator, a battery storage system, a diesel generator, and a reverse osmosis system is proposed. Solar power being intermittent, a variable operation of the reverse osmosis system, in conjunction with a water storage tank, is proposed as a flexible load that can lead to higher energy efficiencies. Modeling of the power components is presented and the design results for different component prices and fuel costs are presented and discussed. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

SRv6 is a source routing solution for IPv6 networks: it allows defining a network path as a sequence of routers, represented by Segments Identifiers (SID), to be crossed, i.e. a Segment List (SL). SRv6 provides a new set of interface counters able to measure the packets/bytes of Ingress/Egress flows exploiting the forwarding operations performed on the Segment Identifiers (SIDs) reported in the SLs. In this work, we formally define the contribution of SR counters in the TM computation procedure, by integrating them in the classical TM Assessment problem. The main outcome of the performance analysis are: i) SR counters can greatly reduce the estimation error and, ii) there is a correlation between the TM assessment improvement and the SLs structure. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

As the voltage regulator is normally designed for unidirectional power flow, this may cause voltage violations on the distribution feeder resulting in faults and cuts. To solve this problem, monitoring of the distribution network is essential before taking any control or protection measures. From this fact emerges the importance of reverse power flow detection. In this paper, the optimal phasor measurement placement for reverse power flow detection is discussed. An extensive literature review and a comparison among a wide range of existing optimization algorithms is done. Then genetic algorithm is selected to solve this problem.

In this work, the potential of harvesting wave energy to produce electrical power on the Lebanese shore is investigated. As such, a compact wave-harvesting device was built. This device is based on a point absorber, which uses the heaving motion of the waves to pump sea water to a storage tank located at a reasonably higher elevation. The water will then flow due to gravity to a lower level where it will be used to operate a hydroelectric turbine and consequently produce electricity. The different components of the system as well as the operation process are detailed. A prototype was built and successfully tested near shore for ordinary weather conditions. The test results will be summarized along with the potential improvements that can be applied to the system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The interest of Telecom operators and Internet service providers (ISPs) is directed to reducing the energy consumption, especially at the base station which is the main energy consumer in the cellular network. The continuous increase of subscribers and the spread of services offered have motivated this interest. Following this increase, a lot of projects and techniques were established to demonstrate how to save energy in next generation wireless networks. The two main reasons for \u00bbGreen Communication\u00bb are reducing CO2 emission and minimizing the operating expenditure (OPEX) for cellular networks. The challenge remains in the idea of accomplishing this decrease without having any negative effect on the quality of service (QoS) required for the users and the network's performance. In this paper, the desire to move toward green communication is discussed by evaluating the amount of saved energy that can be reached by adopting a cooperative management between two operators providing network resources within the same region. We will use both networks in high traffic times, while one of them will be turned off during weak traffic periods. When the operator is switched off, its subscribers are granted roaming over the other network that is still on. The obtained simulation results have shown significant energy saving. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This presents the network with varying Quality of Service (QoS) and security requirements. Consequently, there is a need to classify Internet traffic to facilitate its management. Thus, a granular classification based on needs is required, one which relates better to the network requirements of the traffic. In this paper, we apply deep learning to classify traffic requiring different QoS and security policies. We propose a multi-level classification framework applying a new data representation method. A comparison between the proposed data representation method and a previous method is presented. The implementation results show that the proposed data representation model outperforms the previous one and promises to permit the classification of the traffic at different granularity. Recording up to 95% accuracy using only the size, interarrival time, direction, transport protocol of the first 16 packets of each flow, our method can be employed in an online classification platform. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "High peak demand is one of the major problems induced by the penetration of a high number of Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) on the distribution system. Although time-varying electricity price, demand response, and incentive programs are suggested in many papers as solutions to smooth the peak-load, the results are not satisfactory. For example, in the presence of a dynamic price, all PEVs at homes tend to charge during periods when the electricity price is low. They may create peak demands that exceed the transformer power limit in unexpected periods when the power consumption is low. The situation gets worse when a fixed price is used in some countries and regions. PEVs tend to charge at any time without considering the presence or not of a peak load. To solve the problem of high penetration level of PEVs, we propose three novel contributions as follows, (i) a novel power Soft-Constraint at home level, (ii) a novel Multilevel Power-based Soft-Constraint, and (iii) a new Multilevel Power-based Electricity Tariff System are proposed. Simulation results show that our approach improves the integration of PEVs even when high penetration level is considered and even when fixed electricity price is used. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Moroccan authorities are fully aware about this challenge and works to promote the use of renewable energy sources, particularly solar energy. In this context, this study aims to assess and calculate the technical and economical photovoltaic potential in urban environment and locate suitable roofs for the installation of solar system. To achieve this goal, this study requires the use of solar radiation tool and a 3D model (DSM) generated from a vectorized Orthophoto derived from Photogrammetric restitution. The solar radiation is developed by Solar Analyst ArcGIS tool. The average technical and economical PV potential on each roof is calculated for the most common solar panel technologies (Monocrystalline Mono-Si and Polycrystalline Poly-Si). The applicability of this methodology demonstrated in a selected urban area in Casablanca, Morocco and can be generalized to any other region. The results can be an initial assessment of the solar potential in the city that can be used to support management decision regarding investment in solar system in urban environment. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In our previous work, we have already shown a performance improvement made possible by SDN when using Linear Programming (LP) to find the optimal routing solution as compared to OSPF and ECMP. However, while multipath routing may be required to utilise a network to its maximum capacity, this may cause packet re-ordering, which negatively affects TCP performance. To overcome this limitation and improve TCP performance at a flow level, in this work we replace the LP routing algorithm with a multi-objective genetic algorithm to solve the Multi Commodity Flow problem. This also resolves the scalability problem in LP, and additionally allows us to choose good solutions that offer the smallest number of flow splits whilst maintaining a good compromise in terms of the total network flow and the total cost of the selected paths. While the chosen solution may not offer the best overall network usage, it improves performance at the flow level because the packet reordering problem is reduced. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Organic waste generation is constantly increasing due to industrialization and various treatment processes. Nowadays, anaerobic digestion, as a green technology, is widely used to convert organic waste, into methane, and subsequently, into bioenergy. In this study, our main objective was to evaluate the feasibility of applying anaerobic digestion to treat Lebanese olive by-products, in particular olive pomace. Biochemical fractionation of our biomass showed high contents of cellulose (55.4% of total solids) and lignin (21.3% of total solids) which could limit the anaerobic digestion and result in low methane yield. Biochemical methane potential was assessed using anaerobic digesters in batch mode. These digesters containing the substrate and inoculum in a ratio substrate to inoculum of 1:3 (total solids basis) were incubated at 37\u00b0C. Results from anaerobic digestion showed that olive pomace is a great source of green energy. Alkaline pretreatment was effective in altering the lignocellulosic fractions of olive pomace. But when pretreated samples were subjected to anaerobic digestion, an inhibition occurred because of the formation of toxic compounds, mainly when higher NaOH dosages were used. Alkaline pretreatment also influenced the methane production rate constants and slowed down the anaerobic digestion process. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Fundamentally, proposed method includes simplified algorithm based on analytical model of phase shift that could be applied on all topologies of multi-level converters and MMCs. Each voltage level is generated through comparing a set of carrier signals with the reference waveform. The method is explained for generating three voltage levels and then it is extended to produce n voltage levels at the output of inverters. Eventually, simulation results are presented on different types of multilevel inverters including 5-level H-bridge Neutral point clamped (5L-HNPC), 7-level Packed U-cell (PUC-7) and 15-level cascade H-bridge with 7 cells to validate the performance of the proposed modulation technique. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This realization is due to the significant developments and increase in reliance on renewable energy resources. Wind power stations acquired dominant investments in utility-scale projects known as wind farms [1]. Aligned with selecting proper sites, wind turbine assemblage has extensive impact on the overall productivity and efficiency of the power station. The proficiency of a Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) is accompanied by competent election of generator and electrical control systems; where the latter is multiplied and expanded to structure an adept wind farm. This paper investigates, models and simulates a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind power system coupled to a back to back power converter and controlled by a vector control strategy. The DFIG based wind farm is simulated under fixed step where results are conferred and assessed. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Volt/VAr control (VVC) has a primary objective of removing voltage violations, and a secondary objective of minimizing the real power loss. Volt/VAr control operates on capacitor switches, transformer taps, and the reactive power set-points of distributed generation. In this paper, the VVC problem is solved using mixed-integer conic programming to establish a globally optimal benchmark. To improve computational performance, a discrete coordinate-descent algorithm is employed, starting from a solution to the continuous relaxation of the VVC mixed-integer conic program. Numerical results are reported on radial distribution networks with up to 3146 nodes. The results reveal that the discrete coordinate-descent algorithm, when initialized by solving a continuous conic program, can give solutions that are very close to the global optimum; these solutions are obtained within a very reasonable computing time and are superior to initiating the search from the current operating point. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Router Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a traditional way to filter traffic on cloud computing selectively. However, a large number of rules may be required, whereas the storage capacity of router Ternary Content Addressable Memories (TCAMs) is scarce and expensive. This paper proposes a Network Functions Virtualization (NFV)/Software-Defined Networking (SDN) security framework, named ACLFLOW. ACLFLOW (i) translates regular ACLs (source/destination IP, source/destination port, and protocol) into OpenFlow filtering rules; (ii) creates and manages large OpenFlow ACLs on distributed software switches, which act as security virtual network functions (named OpenFlow VNF-ACLs), to address the TCAM storage capacity problem; (iii) implements a proposed algorithm to dynamically prioritize the most popular rule to accelerate switching operations; and (iv) orchestrates and accelerates the deployment of NFV/SDN environments into production clouds. We have implemented a framework prototype into the Open Platform for NFV (OPNFV) and evaluated its performance using different tools and scenarios. Results show that OpenFlow VNF-ACL improves maximum throughput by up to 90%, its HTTP request rates are up to 50% better, and it reduces Round Trip Time (RTT) by 70% when its performance is compared with a stateless Iptables running in virtual machines. Moreover, the proposed algorithm dynamically improves HTTP request rate of flows with the highest traffic volume by 15% and reduces RTT by 25% when compared with ACLFLOW without prioritization. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The next-generation networks (5G) aims to support services that demand strict requirements such as low-latency, high throughput, and high availability. Telecom operators have adopted Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) to virtualize the network functions and deploy at distributed cloud datacenters. Deploying virtual network functions (VNFs) close to the end-user can reduce Internet latency. However, network congestion in telco cloud datacenters can result in increased latency, low network utilization and a drop of throughput. The existing protocols are not capable of utilizing the multiple paths offered by datacenter topologies e.g., DCTCP; require a major architectural change and face deployment challenges e.g., NDP; or increase flow completion times of short flows e.g., MPTCP. To address this, we propose a multipath transport for telco cloud datacenters called coupled multipath datacenter TCP, MDTCP. MDTCP evolves MPTCP subflows to employ ECN signals to react to congestion before queue overflow, offering both reduced latency and higher network utilization. The evaluation of MDTCP with simulated traffic indicates comparable or lower flow completion times compared with DCTCP and NDP for most of the studied traffic scenarios. The simulation results imply that MDTCP could give better throughput for telco traffic and at the same time be as fair as MPTCP in datacenters. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This site was chosen due to several reasons including its distinctive location in the heart of Bekaa valley, which is special for its climate and affordable land. The project started with the preparation of the site to match the green requirements. This village called \u00bbHeliopolis Compound\u00bb contains 40 residential villas for the first stage. This paper completely covers the green design and certification of the residential villas. Each villa was perfectly designed to meet the GRASS green building rating system and thus getting the GRASS certification, validating that the design is highly successful and feasible. Meeting the level 1 \u00bbEmerald\u00bb of GRASS yielded an estimated over cost of 10% and the payback period of all improvements varies from 2 to 8 years depending on technology choices. Designing this compound was the first step in the long journey of green thinking in residential sector in Lebanon, and we hope it will be the bedrock of upcoming ideas concerning the green path we intended to follow. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Fixed and mobile network providers employ frequently load-balancers that use multiple paths on either per-flow or per-destination level, but very seldom on per-packet level. Despite of the benefits of packet-level load balancing mechanisms (e.g., low computational complexity and high bandwidth utilization) network providers can't use them mainly because of TCP packet reorderings that harm TCP performance. Emerging network architectures also support multiple paths, but they face with the same obstacle in balancing their load to multiple paths. Indeed, packet level load balancing research is paralyzed by the reordering vulnerability of TCP.A couple of TCP variants exist that deal with TCP packet reordering problem, but due to lack of end-to-end transparency they were not widely deployed and adopted. In this paper, we revisit TCP's packet reorderings problem and present a transparent and light-weight algorithm, Out-of-Order Robustness for TCP with Transparent Acknowledgment (ACK) Intervention (ORTA), to deal with out-of-order deliveries.ORTA works as a transparent thin layer below TCP and hides harmful side-effects of packet-level load balancing. ORTA monitors all TCP flow packets and uses ACK traffic shaping, without any modifications to either TCP sender or receiver sides. Since it is transparent to TCP end-points, it can be easily deployed on TCP sender end-hosts (EHs), gateway (GW) routers, or access points (APs). ORTA opens a door for network providers to use per-packet load balancing.The proposed ORTA algorithm is implemented and tested in NS-2. The results show that ORTA can prevent TCP performance decrease when per-packet load balancing is used. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In addition, a hybrid server is added to the platform to enable enhanced performance and functionality. To showcase the potential impacts of augmented reality (AR) based applications in an IoT infrastructure, we implemented and tested the maintenance support application.

This work addresses dynamic modeling, control and performance analysis of a PV/Batteries/Ultra capacitor hybrid energy system connected to a DC load in a remote house located around the town of Rouyn Noranda (Quebec-Canada) during one day in winter period. The PO MPPT control is used to extract the maximum power of a photovoltaic generator which is considered as the main energy source of the hybrid system. In this paper, batteries and ultra-capacitors (UC) are serving as an energy storage system (ESS) and a main source in winter period. The UC are used for facing high frequency variations of the load, such as in transient state, while the batteries are in charge of slow load/source variations. Classical control of battery current and ultra-capacitor current allows choosing the suitable storage element in order to face correctly the production/consummation variations. Classical PI control strategy is proposed in manner to stabilize the DC bus voltage by controlling the attached DC/DC bidirectional converters. Simulations during 00 AM to 3 PM (during a snowy day) are carried out using Matlab/Simulink which confirm the good performances of the hybrid system and associated control systems. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

While other aspects of the technology have been recently studied, the problem of obtaining accurate information regarding the aerodynamic behavior of the suspended cylinder as its spin ratio varies remains open. This paper presents an adaptation of an existing estimation strategy based on a constrained Extended Kalman filter (EKF) for the aerodynamic characterization of a small-scale Magnus effect-based AWE prototype. The evaluation is performed on data obtained during wind tunnel experiments, and results indicate that, after minor modifications, the chosen approach can indeed be applied to Magnus effect-based AWE systems. Moreover, provided that the cylinder's angular velocity is available, it can be employed for approximately determining the relationship existing between the aerodynamic coefficients of lift and drag and the spin ratio of the airborne structure. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "                             The availability of some kinds of renewable energy resources is un-continuous, for example the solar collectors can only produce heat when the sun is shining. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) is crucial to match between the intermittent solar heat supply and the heat demand. In this paper, a Phase Change Material (PCM) is integrated in the Domestic Solar Hot Water Storage Tank (DSHWST) as a Latent Heat Storage (LHT). Based on the application requirements in Lebanon, a suitable PCM is selected. While this PCM solidifies, it releases its heat and keeps the water inside the DSHWST warmer than 55 \u00b0C along 10 hours. The needed mass of PCM was calculated and two types of containers were investigated: the tubes and the spheres. As well as, the comparison between DSHWST integrated with PCM (DSHWST-PCM) and the Conventional Domestic Solar Hot Water Storage Tank (CDSHWST) is introduced, in order to examine the performance of PCM heating against that with an Electrical Resistance (ER). Features are expressed in terms of system payback and CO                             <sub>2</sub>                              emission. Due to the issue of electrical power availability in Lebanon, the PCM integrated in The DSHWST has the following two advantages: yearly, reducing the primary electricity power by about 6.5 MWh and get rid of about 5.5 tons of CO                             <sub>2</sub>                             .                          \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Utilizing renewable energy and associated energy-efficient technology has developed a strategy for energy-saving in the most energy consumer sectors, especially for buildings. Geothermal energy as an energy-saving and environment-friendly renewable technology has been widely adopted in the building sector. In this study, a new earth-to-air heat exchanger (EAHE) system with vertically buried tubes utilizing geothermal energy was proposed. Compared to the conventional EAHE systems, its advantages mainly include high geothermal energy utilization efficiency and ease of condensate water discharge. To evaluate the thermal performance of the proposed new EAHE system, an experimental set-up was established and a series of tests were conducted. Meanwhile, a numerical model for this proposed system was developed and then validated by the monitored experimental data. The monitored result show that the outlet air temperature ranges from 22.4\u00b0C to 24.2\u00b0C as the air flow velocity set at 1 m/s, enabling it to be used as an efficient energy-saving technology for summer cooling of buildings. The validated result show that the developed numerical model has a highly consistent result with the monitored experimental data, and their maximum error for outlet air temperatures is less than 0.74\u00b0C with a relative deviation of 3.11%. Based on the developed numerical model, the inlet air velocity is certified with an important influence on the thermal performance of this proposed system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The results are compared to previous experimental results in order to calibrate and validate the numerical model.

However, the majority of IoT devices have little or no protection at software and infrastructure levels and thus are also opening up new vulnerabilities that might be misused by cybercriminals to perform large-scale cyber attacks by means of IoT botnets. These kind of attacks lead to infrastructure and service outages and cause enormous financial loss, image and reputation damage. One approach to proactively block the spreading of such IoT botnets is to automatically scan for vulnerable IoT devices and isolate them from the Internet before they are compromised and also become part of the IoT botnet. The goal of this paper is to present an IoT botnet detection and isolation approach at the level of access routers that makes IoT devices more attack resilient. We show that our IoT botnet detection and isolation approach helps to prevent the compromise of IoT devices without the need to have in-depth technical administration knowledge, and hence make it viable for customers and end users. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Solar water heating system is transient in nature and its performance depends on dynamic parameters. Transient system simulations using SimSol and Solo softwares are done in order to assess the performance of the solar water heater for different weather files and component parameters. In a first step, the analysis was based on a definition of Domestic Hot Water demands performed by the scientific and technical center for building. Afterwards, 16 single component parametric variations for Centralized and Individual SWH are performed and analyzed. The results showed that the different parameters may increase the solar gain energy and reduce the heat losses through the system components. Impacts of these parameters are quantified for weather conditions in Lebanon. A simplified sizing procedure for solar domestic hot water systems is also presented. Finally, Requirements for the Chapter Hot Water of the Lebanese Energy Building Code are proposed based on the simulation results as a minimum energy efficiency measures which demonstrate the purpose of this endeavor. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The approach impacts the telco business ecosystem significantly. In this paper, we discuss two business models that are enabled by network slicing. One of them is applicable to a single infrastructure domain, whereas another concerns the involvement of multiple infrastructure and slice providers through the use of the brokering mechanism. We have also discussed the implementation of the business models. In that context, we have shown the shortcomings of the ETSI NFV MANO architecture in a multi-provider environment and proposed its modifications. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this paper, a pilot BIPV system is studied with respect to aesthetical and technical requirements, and installed on the fa\u00e7ade of an office building in Beirut. The aim of the research is to test the energy performance of the BIPV system through modelling and experimental investigation in hybrid configuration with building back-up diesel generators-a Lebanese particularity due to utility shortage in power supply. This first BIPV project in Lebanon has a capacity of 30 kWp. It has a special architectural integration benefiting from available solar energy estimated to be around 2000 kWh/m2/year to produce electric power, and reduces the consumption of diesel generators that runs the building during working hours. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

We have proposed a method to detect android malware using permissions and API. We have generated two types of feature vector named as common and combined feature vector. We obtained 97.25% accuracy for common and 96.56% accuracy for combined features using logistic regression. Further, to reduce training and testing time of classification we have optimized the feature to 131 by removing low variance features with which we have achieved 95.87% accuracy. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The LTE has to ensure seamless handover for delay-critical services. Handover procedure always tries to make user equipment (UE) associated with the most suitable eNodeB. Prediction of handover under various mobility conditions is very complicated. The LTE standard supports handover parameters to make the handover decision and to choose the target eNodeB. Thus requires careful handover parameter setting to make handover successful. At the time of handover procedure the handover-related signaling messages are transmitted using shared radio channel. Packet loss is the key cause of handover associated signaling message drops at the wireless link. A number of error consequences occur at the control channels has impact on the transmission of handover signaling messages. The error in transmitting handover-related signaling messages affect all other data or control packets causes the handover failure and delay. We analyze the influence of handover parameters in an error-prone channel. The handover performance is investigated with changing User Equipment (UE) speeds in ns-3. We have observed all of these parameters need to be carefully selected with respect to the error rate in the wireless radio channel. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

As a solution, in distributed storage, batteries are used as dispatchable loads in demand side for balancing the supply-demand mismatch. This article proposes design and development of a Battery Monitoring and Control Unit (BMACU) for the batteries used in distributed storage. The BMACU facilitates monitoring of State of Charge (SoC) and updating the computed value in the utility server. The control unit allows various modes of charging of battery based on SoC and the current scenario. BMACU enables fast charging if there is excess power generation and discharge the battery during deficit, thus improving system reliability. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The design of router and switching matrix is made by considering the losses due to various fundamental components used in the router and symmetry of the components while placing them in the design. Thus, the achieved design results in the reduction of crossings and at the same time is the most symmetrical design. The proposed router uses sixteen MRRs, four bends and fourteen crossings. Analysis of the router shows a reduction in insertion losses because of the decrease in the number of crossings. Moreover, the principle used to switch on and off the MRR is based on the thermo-optic effect. In comparison to other designs of optical routers, the proposed design can be viewed as most symmetric design and give better results in term of fewer losses, more switching speed and lower power consumption. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The area around a mobile unit (i.e. micro-environment) is observed continuously by the sensors (contextual data sources) to detect and record changes in the event that occurs. Data is recorded (raw data) if an event changes and this data is processed through signal processing and information according to the type of activity is extracted and the overall process results in context recognition. Once the context is recognized then respective applications are invoked for execution of their respective functionalities. The background running tasks/process amounts to a whooping power consumption which ultimately amounts negative towards the overall system performance. Smart Sensing System works for full utilization of the resources and stopping redundant tasks from being executed, thus boosts the efficiency of the system and the user as well. Smart Sensing System is a singular system which automatically increases the productivity of the Smartphone. It also has the security feature which helps the user as well as the mobile in emergency condition like Access Notification to the Smartphone. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this work we present results on a novel method to directly measure the conversion efficiency of a TPV device. This method relies on the direct measurement of the electrical power and the heat dissipated by the TPV cell in the steady state.

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth in data services including multimedia downloading, video conferencing, live streaming and mobile TV in the last few years, there has been increased demand of LTE broadcasting. However, there are many challenges in this area and one of the biggest problems occurs when several users subscribe to the same multimedia service. Then it becomes inefficient to transmit the same content multiple times to subscribers via unicast. This problem is aggravated when the number of users coming in between the multicast session is huge. In order to overcome this, dynamic scenario is proposed that incorporates Device-to-Device (D2D) communication along with Multimedia Broadcasting and Multicasting Services of LTE. This is achieved by integrating multicasting and D2D communication between the users. The performance of static as well as dynamic scenario is compared on various metrics. In addition to this, performance of various device discovery protocols supporting this model has been analyzed and compared with static scenario. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

To overcome sidelobe problem a new approach for reducing sidelobe levels has been proposed and compared with the conventional method of MCPC radar signal which uses the P4 phase sequence. The proposed method utilizes Zad-off Chu phase sequence, where it performs the Hadamard product of chosen ZC sequence. Identifying correct Zad-off Chu phase series is very essential to attain better sidelobe reduction. This technique is applied to higher order MCPC signals and a comparison of the peak sidelobe ratio (PSLR) and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR) is performed. The complex envelopes, autocorrelations and ambiguity functions of the MCPC signal are obtained from the above mentioned method. The proposed method achieves better sidelobe reduction which can be suppressed up to 6 dB. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The objective is to model the traffic of the wireless network, since it is underused in this region of Latin America. Hence, some tools are studied to allow the structuring of the type of traffic seen in the network. Based on stochastic tools such as the log-scale diagram, the linear multiscale diagram, and the multifractal spectrum, this research aims to verify the multifractality of traffic series collected on the electric radio spectrum of Bogot\u00e1, Colombia in 2012. In fact, the study reveals that all the channels of the network have a multifractal behavior with 90% of them presenting a Hurst parameter in the 0.5 to 1 range. The evidence suggests that the traffic in this region could be modeled as multifractal time series. Therefore, the analysis carried out intends to provide a new modeling method for the Colombian radioelectric spectrum in the form of a multifractal-based analysis. \u00a9 IEEE-CONFERENCE.

Still sometimes we face a cold start problem and we do not get accurate recommendations. We have proposed an extra favourable position of these systems which is clients can encode more data about their relations than essentially say who they trust. Along with trust we have also proposed a transitivity in social networks through which we can get more accurate recommendations. We have achieved sufficient results which prove this approach of transitivity between nodes is helpful for better recommendations. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The main issue of securing the data and information is born from the dependency upon the encoding and steganography individually. Because of that, the hidden secret messages can be easily broken and contents are detected. The image watermarking is the method of embedding hidden data into original image for the purpose of security. In this paper, we have purposed a new watermarking technique combined with RSA and fractal image coding for the purpose of image security and high image quality, with the help of which we have tried to overcome the drawbacks of previous watermarking techniques. In this new technique the information or the watermark is encoded using RSA and the encoded image is hidden into the fractal codes of an image. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm enhances the security against attacks such as cutting, random noise attack and JPEG compression and provide high quality of image. Results of proposed method are better as compared to results of fractal image watermarking that are measuring by parameters such PSNR, BER and MSE. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Eye tracker gives the patterns of visual attention of the observer which is analyzed in terms of fixations and saccades. The proposed work is used eye tracker for training the system of automatic detection of no-entry sign board. The whole process is divided into three stages: in first stage, fixation point is collected from an eye-tracker device. In second stage, objects are tagged by k-means clustering algorithm applied on fixation points. In third stage, the system is trained using cascade training algorithm to detect the objects automatically. No-entry sign boards are considered as the target in the proposed work. Detection of objects is based on fixation points rather than analyzing the features of all the pixels of the images. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this work, a novel method for detecting crowd abnormal activities is proposed which is based on processing of optical flow as motion parameter for machine learning. The proposed model makes use of magnitude vector which represents motion magnitude of a block in eight directions divided by a 45 degree pace angle. Further, motion characteristics are processed using Motion Descriptor Map (MDP), which takes two main parameters namely aggregate magnitude of motion flow in a block and Euclidean distance between blocks. Here, the angle of deviation between any two blocks determines which among the eight values in the magnitude vector to be considered for further processing. The algorithm is tested with two standard datasets namely UMN and UCSD Datasets. Apart from these the system is also tested with a custom dataset. On an average, an overall accuracy of 98.08% was obtained during experimentation. \u00a9 IEEE-CONFERENCE. All rights reserved.",

This paper centers on progressing an ANN to classify and detect a fault on power transmission line. The study employs feed-forward ANN with back-propagation algorithm in evolving the fault detector classifier. Simulation and modelling of transmission lines was done in MATLAB using simpowersystems Toolbox. The instant currents and voltage numeric are taken after training the fault classifier detector. Simulation results have been delivered to determine the effectiveness of the technologically advanced intellectual detector classifier for fault. The performance of the classifier detector is assessed by the Mean Square Error (MSE) and confusion matrix. The detector attained a tolerable MSE of 8.5571e-7 and accuracy of 100%. The classifier attained a tolerable MSE of 0.63035 and accuracy of 88%, presenting that the performance of the technologically advanced intellectual classifier detector is acceptable. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "As indicated by various Organization, water pollution executes around 1.2 Million deaths in India Every Year. None of the Indian cities compiles with water quality standard provided by World Health Organization. Water Pollution is the single greatest natural wellbeing hazard. Keeping in mind the end goal to balance this rising issue and make a move to tidy up Indian water (and Indeed water far and wide), it's important to first distinguish where is the most contamination concentrated, how it happens, what components are included and how we can kill them. So as to do this, far reaching water checking must be attempted on a national and global scale. This issue needs to be concerned about and what help we can get from the technology we have around us is going to be high pointed. This will also be rendered that how IoT will have its significance for making and recreating the innovative water quality Index. A Water Quality Index (WQI) denotes to the statistics to the public where in water quality data can be seen in consistent manner which being supplied to them. This index is as similar as the AQI (Air Quality Index) and UVI (Ultra Violet Index) which states the quality from its supply to the public. Several methods can be applied to assess the quality of the water but in order to avoid the quality complexity due to the parameter consideration, WQI is rather a superlative method to be opted for the said assessment. As far as IoT is concerned, Internet of things (IoT) is the between frameworks organization of physical contraptions, vehicles (in like manner insinuated as 'related devices' and 'clever devices'), structures, and distinctive things - embedded with equipment, programming, sensors, actuators, and framework arrange that engage these articles to accumulate and exchange data. IoT has been called 'the structure of the information society' by the Global Standards Initiative on Internet of Things (IoT-GSI) in 2013. With many powerful IoT devices, one such being the Raspberry Pi, we can develop applications that will help in the above explained issue which also aid our lives to get easy and can save our time and energy by automating things with the help of Internet. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "In the age of the real-time web, online news media aggregators, like Google News, and social media sites, like Twitter, strive for effective and efficient filtering of great volumes of information for millions of users. Given the massive diversity and burstiness of information published on the web every minute, filtering, ranking as well as delivering content streams to interested users come to be a challenging task. Furthermore, feedback signals on the content, such as clicks or shares, offer beneficial information on content significance, but also need more complex manipulation techniques for filtering these streams. Scoring functions in this context cogitate both static as well as dynamic ranking factors, such as profile relevance, recency of information and dynamic feedback signals. Present works for the real-time web fail to handle such dynamic scoring functions in an online way as well as rather adjust an approach of iterative execution of snapshot queries. In this work we proposed effectual evaluation techniques of continuous top-k queries over text as well as feedback streams including generalized scoring functions which capture dynamic ranking features. As a first contribution, we generalize state of the art continuous top-k query models, by presenting a common family of nonhomogeneous scoring functions merging query-independent item significance with query-dependent content relevance as well as continuous score decay reflecting information freshness. Our second contribution involves in the definition as well as implementation of efficient in-memory data structures for indexing and evaluating this new family of continuous top-k queries. Our experimentations show that our solution is scalable and outperforms other present state of the art solutions, when restricted to homogeneous functions. Going a step further, in the second portion of this thesis we study the problem of incorporating dynamic feedback signals to the original scoring function in addition to propose a new general real time query evaluation framework with a family of new algorithms for resourcefully processing continuous top-k queries with dynamic feedback scores in a real-time web context. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Due to the revolution of the internet and availability of 4G internet speed with low cost, lots of images are being generated and shared on a day which required a good and accurate retrieval system. The textual system creates language indistinctness problem. So, CBIR system is established to overcome the problem like manual annotation and language indistinctness. The knowledge of computer vision is used for image retrieval based on some low-level features like color, shape, and texture. The most important parts of the CBIR system are the computational complexity and the retrieval accuracy. The machine learning helps to improve the accuracy of the system. In this paper, Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is used due to the property of direct feature extraction from the image. Computer vision techniques are used to extract low-level features from the image while CNN is used to extract high-level features from the image. The CNN extract the features from the image as well as to classify the image which removes unnecessary images and increase retrieval accuracy. As the number of convolution layers increases the more high-level features can be extracted but it will increase the training time. The results of CBIR are compared for one layer of CNN and two layers of CNN. The average precision rate is used to compare CNN based technique with the different fusion techniques of computer vision. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It is internetworking of physical devices which will detect, collect, process and exchange data. As it needs to get connected over the internet, these things (devices) have an IP address associated to them. The devices use some kind of identifiers to communicate with other different devices. The goal of Internet of things is to establish a communication using any networking technology between any types of physical devices at any place. Its final aim is to connect to the internet. The IoT framework aspires to connect anyone with anything anywhere. With great advancement of IoT and its increasing implementation in today's world it becomes very important to secure the network to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of the IoT network. There are various protocols which are used to make up an IoT devices or an IoT network. These protocols are different from standard networking protocols. Bluetooth is one of the protocols which are used in some of the IoT devices to communicate with the other devices. Some of the IoT devices use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to communicate with the other device. This paper presents real-time hacking of Smart Bulb which uses BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) protocol. The real time penetration testing of an IoT device was performed which uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to communicate with the other devices. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In this perspective, this paper presents a hybrid DEEKH algorithm by combining differential evolution (DE) with an enhanced version of krill herd (EKH) in a new conceptual fashion. The motion of KH individuals are mostly influenced by its neighbors. The control parameters in enhanced KH (EKH) are updated dynamically to avoid the krill individuals being trapped at local optima by preserving the basic structure of KH algorithm. The DE algorithm has the potential of better exploration of problem search domain. In DEEKH, the solution is further improved by improving the exploitative nature of EKH through sharing of information during the search process. The potential of the proposed DEEKH is validated using six standard benchmark functions. From simulation study, it is verified that the proposed DEEKH provides superior results and highly viable with the existing state of the art. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The solution is provided by a sensor based hardware module which can be placed along roads. These modules can be placed on lamp posts and they transfer information about air quality wirelessly to remote server. This information can be used for traffic control.

The industry 4.0 adds the abundant value in the production systems of companies to address the current and future marketplace competition as well as challenges. The digital architectures aid the companies to establish the ordering-procurement digital network among vendors and manufacturers. It is observed that companies are seeking an empirical IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) mapping technique for measuring the performance of own partners considering IIoT architectures. Apart from this, companies are also stress to evaluate the significant IIoT architectures to establish the universal single layer IIoT architectures model, which could execute the said technique. In responds to entire research gaps, at first stage the authors conduct a few relevant literature surveys in the field of IIoT to shortlist only momentous IIoT architectures for establishing the universal model. Additionally, a few literature surveys assist the authors to evaluate the empirical IIoT mapping technique for benchmarking own partner/suppliers. The authors quantify the research work with finalizing the IIoT architectures i.e. cyber physical system, networking, virtual reality, data storage system and security to be associated with model. Furthermore, the authors implement a fuzzy-grey relational analysis computational technique on IIoT model for benchmarking suppliers. The objective of research is to facilitate the industry 4.0 based companies with a proposed universal model cum empirical technique so that companies could map the performance of own partners under proposed model. The hypothetical data in conducted empirical case research of a SA automation technology based company justified the real application of research work. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It consists of two parts: Smart Water Quantity meter and Smart Water Quality meter. The objective of designing Smart Water Quantity Meter is to ensure water conservation by monitoring the amount of water consumed by a household, notifying the same to the consumer and the authority. A three-slab billing system generates consumption bill according to the quantity consumed. The Smart Water Quality meter checks the purity of portable water that the consumer receives, by measuring five qualitative parameters of water viz. pH, temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen and conductivity. The system ensures to prevent any health hazards or potential threats caused due to accidental seepage of sewage or farm release into the portable water. An online monitoring system is to provide these data on the cloud in real-time. Any violations in either the usage limit or water quality is immediately notified to the consumer and authority via SMS and an alert signal generated by the system. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "With the ever-advancing technology, our electricity consumption is taking a hike, too. To indemnify this hike, the power engineers have to ensure that the consumers get an uninterrupted power supply. Unfortunately, the conventional grid is no longer reliable to provide a continuous power supply to the consumers. So, the power industry has switched onto the new power generation sources like solar photovoltaic, wind energy systems, hydel power etc. Out of these, solar photovoltaic has proved to be the most efficient one. In this paper, we shall integrate the solar power with the conventional grid and study the effects of high solar penetration on the conventional grid. The problems which arise due to high solar penetration include load variation, voltage rise and reverse power flow. Also, the sporadic nature of solar PV makes the system a bit unstable. So, to resolve all these issues, a new FACTS device, UPFC has been used. The UPFC ameliorates the voltage profile of the system as the series converter of UPFC injects an ac bus voltage into the system. Also, during the specified switching time, the UPFC removes the power oscillations arising at the utility grid side. The model also enhances the voltage profile of the system and increases the power at the grid side. The model is simulated on MATLAB Simulink and simulation outcomes have been shown. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Science and technology always try to make human life easier. The people who are having complete blindness or low vision faces many difficulties during their navigation. Blindness can occur due to many reasons including disease, injury or other conditions that limit vision. The main purpose of this paper is to develop a navigation aid for the blind and the visually impaired people. In this paper, we design and implement a smart cap which helps the blind and the visually impaired people to navigate freely by experiencing their surroundings. The scene around the person will be captured by using a NoIR camera and the objects in the scene will be detected. The earphones will give a voice output describing the detected objects. The architecture of the system includes the processor Raspberry Pi 3, NoIR camera, earphones and a power source. The processor collects the frames of the surroundings and convert it to voice output. The device uses TensorFlow API, open-source machine learning library developed by the Google Brain Team for the object detection and classification. TensorFlow helps in creating machine learning models capable of identifying and classifying multiple objects in a single image. Thus, details corresponding to various objects present within a single frame are obtained using TensorFlow API. A Text to Speech Synthesiser (TTS) software called eSpeak is used for converting the details of the detected object (in text format) to speech output. So the video captured by using the NoIR camera is finally converted to speech signals and thus narration of the scene describing various objects is done. Objects which come under 90 different classes like cell phone, vase, person, couch etc are detected. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In general, any FER technique contains three steps: feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification. Dimensionality and feature selection are major issues concerning FER. Huge amount of memory and processing are required to process image as a whole. A more suitable alternative to this problem is geometric features. In this paper, facial landmark detection has used for feature extraction and Convolutional Neural Network Classifier. The method has tested on publicly available benchmark datasets: JAFFE, MUG, CK, and MMI. The results with the proposed methodology outperform the existing methods found in the literature. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The rank is calculated based on spatial location, text and attributes. The result contains k objects satisfying the user's requirements. It returns the nearest neighbor of user's current location based on specified query keyword. Instead of considering all hotels, the nearest neighbor query ask for hotels that are nearby and provide services such as gym/spa, pool, internet and also have high health and hotel ratings at the same time. We propose a framework called SKQP (Spatial Keyword Query Processing) to process these types of queries. Three data structures R-tree, Inverted files and Concept tree are used to process the location, keywords (pool, internet) and numerical attributes (health and hotel ratings) respectively. The combined structure is the backbone of SKQP framework. SKQP can process the GLRQs efficiently. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

It will not test new link or new thing but here what we are trying anything is new it can understand from previous experience and try to apply experience to get new results. This approach can be achieved by a three-layer structure: Web scraper, Machine Learning (ML) and Selenium. Web page would be tested and it would be trained to a system from a human perceptive in such a way that the system able to understand what are the test cases that need to be followed for each and every element on the web page and system next time on wards will do sanity and smoke test based on those inputs intelligently going to those elements on the website. System learns what actions to be done for a particular web element like button. The outputs that are able to get it is even classified the kind of output, for example, is error page or is the page is not intended. This approach helps the larger business organization to align themselves more with a creative task in testing rather than doing the human repeated activity. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

For timely detection of the fetal arrhythmias, monitoring fetal ECGs constantly is important. In this paper, we are presenting the framework for detection of fetal from maternal ECG based on sparse binary matrix using Compressive Sensing. Additionally, we are presenting the preprocessing algorithm on raw fetus ECG data to remove the noises like impulsive artifacts along with notch filtering for baseline removal. The proposed method is on the basis of sparse representation of the components that are acquired using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) method, which is designed for direct application in the compressed domain. Detection of fetal ECG is performed on the basis of activated atoms in a specially designed Gaussian dictionary. The verification of the proposed framework has been carried out on ten samples of Challenge dataset A by determining QRS detection parameters such as sensitivity, S= 90.62% and positive predictivity, given by P+= 99.15%. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Battery determines the lifetime of the network. Therefore, energy is very crucial parameter for wireless sensor network. Existing research is motivated by LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) protocol. We have presented several methods from literature for making routing energy efficient in wireless sensor networks. In existing methods, cluster heads are randomly selected. For selection of cluster head, energy is not considered. Cluster head is replaced for every round. Our proposed method is based on optimum number of cluster head, dynamic cluster size, multi hop approach and cluster headreplacement cost. Simulation result shows that network lifetime is increased using our proposed method. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Photovoltaic systems are good solution to provide energy since it is environmentally friendly, and it has zero variable cost. On the other hand, High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) is gaining importance to transfer power from one grid to another. Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) has made a great contribution for the development of HVDC since it is modular, scalable and cost-effective. Traditional HVDC system consists of two terminals. However, in the case of an unbalanced condition, HVDC lose stability, and it is a challenge to re-run the system if an MMC is built with high number of capacitors. In this study, large-scale PV plant is used as a backup terminal if a fault occurs on one of the grids, and one of the terminals is lost. The system has been built and tested on Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) with the help of FPGA based MMC support unit. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

IoT devices helps to connect all sensors which help to monitor and control electronic or mechanical systems. IoT system are very useful in industries where humans are unable to enter like a radiation room etc. Nowadays IoT systems are used in government sectors for security and in-home security and home automation [4]. But still it's not common as the cost of IoT devices is high and the modularity is less. To make the device modular we need to find a best way of communication protocol so that the latency of the communication will be less. This paper presents the comparison of best to protocol and which is the best protocol which we need to use to reduce the latency and make the device modular and able to control remotely. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Power Electronic converters with its fast electronic switching and standard control configuration have low inertia compared to electromechanical device based energy systems. In this research work, inverter control algorithms for inertial response improvement will be studied. A new inverter topology (photo-voltaic synchronous generator or PVSG) consisting Photo-voltaic unit, and BESS has been proposed. Dynamic response of PVSG unit, control design will be analyzed. Dynamic performance of this new topology has been compared with existing virtual inertia algorithms.

This paper develops the models for cognitive automation and proposes a CAN design that addresses the requirements for 5G and future networks.

        "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) with its core subset of Machine Learning (ML) is rapidly transforming life experiences as humans begin to grow more dependent on these 'smart machines' for their needs - ranging from routine mundane chores to critical personal decisions. However, these transformative technologies are at the same time proving unpredictable too as has been reported worldwide in certain cases. Therefore, several studies/reports, such as COMEST report on Robotics ethics (UNESCO, 2017) point to an obvious needfor inculcating more ethical behavior in machines. The present study aims to look at the role and interplay of ML (the hard sciences) and Ethics (the soft sciences) to resolve such predicaments that are inadvertently manifested by machines not constrained or controlled by human expectations. Based on focused review of literature of both domains-ML and Ethics, the proposed paper attempts to first build on the need for introduction of an ethical algorithm in the domain of machine learning and then endeavors to provide a conceptual framework to resolve the ethical dilemmas. \u00a9 IEEE-CONFERENCE.

        "abstract": "Cloud computing offers enormous benefits to its adopters, but it also comes with its set of problems and inefficiencies of which security is the biggest concern. In order to leverage a remote cloud based infrastructure, a company essentially gives away private data and information that might be sensitive and confidential. Secret sharing schemes are used to restrict access to such sensitive and confidential data. Threshold secret sharing schemes is a scheme in which the number of the participants in the reconstruction phase is important for recovering the secret. In this paper, aiming at tackling the important issue of identity revocation, we are introducing the outsourcing computation into IBE and suggest a revocable IBE scheme should be added in the server-aided setting. Our proposed scheme delivers most of the key generation related operations i.e. key-issuing and Key update processes are performed by Key Update Cloud Service Provider, leaving only a fixed number of simple operations for PKG and users to perform locally. By utilizing a novel collusion-resistant technique, this goal is achieved: we make use of a hybrid private key for each user, in which an AND gate is drawn in to attach and bound the identity component and the time component. In addition, we propose another technique which is verifiable secure under the recently formulized Refereed Delegation of Computation model. To end with, we provide extensive experimental results to reveal the effectiveness of our proposed construction. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) have materialized as a solution to networks that experience persistent partition. Owing to intermittent connectivity finding schemes in multicasting is more complex problem than as compared to mobile ad hoc networks (MANETS). Multicasting in DTN finds its application in varied regions such as in battlefields, catastrophes, deep space communication, etc. For routing DTN uses store, carry and forward technique to transfer the data. Some of the multicasting techniques already proposed utilizes the history information of the nodes to forward the data. Such schemes require better scheduling and needs buffer management. Earlier proposed buffer management techniques show better result in messages unicasting but don't give promising solution in multicasting techniques. In this paper we are proposing an improved Prophet Protocol multicasting in DTN environment. The proposed Protocol has been enhanced by introducing a utility function for prioritizing the messages in buffer beside, choosing the relay node based on the probability of the nodes meeting in future. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Technology has always played a vital role in all aspects of human development. Achieving accurate recognition and categorization of plant leaf is always a challenge to researchers. This paper, therefore aims to put forth various techniques that are adopted for pre-processing, feature extraction and classification of leaf, based on shape and texture features of leaf sample. The paper further presents experimental results carried out on flavia dataset in order to recognize and classify leaves using gray level co-occurrence matrix and hierarchical centroid based technique. This work has considered 300 leaf samples with 30 different classes for the purpose of investigation. Experimental results indicate that from the aforementioned technique, it is possible to attain accuracy up to 96.66%. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

However, these accurate simulations highly depend on inverter models of actual field implementations, which are often unavailable because they are proprietary. To address this problem, we propose a time-domain model identification method that can be used to determine the control models of inverters in continuous time from multiple experimental studies. The focus is on identifying the dynamic representation of controls because they dominate the dynamic response of renewable assets. To illustrate the applicability of the technique, we consider a subclass of inverter controllers for autonomous grid applications that rely on nonlinear oscillators. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Different models are used for different type of applications such as system operation, market operation based on their time horizon. Also, different models use different types of inputs. There are less literature available for the classification of these models based on application, time horizon, input types and predicted outputs. Therefore, this paper classify the solar power prediction models based on time horizon, input types, application and predicted output type and also gives most suitable model for each class. It concludes that position of sun and earth is same corresponding to previous year similar day, only difference is cloud cover and cloud movement, wind speed and temperature. Compared to wind speed and temperature cloud movement and cloud speed have high co relation with solar power. Image processing based on sky imagery data for real time cloud cover and cloud movement along with previous years similar day sky data will give accurate predictions. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "The classification of roads from a satellite image has a scope for high level research due to the variations in topology. So it is quite challenging to classify roads from satellite imagery in a realistic manner. The importance and utility of classifying roads from a satellite image having high resolution can help in the navigation of roads, revision of geographic information systems, in the area of emergency rescue applications and so on. The problem that arises is to identify and differentiate a road segment from its background. The difficulty for classifying a road is the existence of trees, manmade constructions like buildings particularly in an urban landscape. The different types of sensors used in satellites can also have an impact on identifying roads due to its variations. What is required is a fast and accurate method for extraction of roads. This proposed work deals with extraction of a road network from satellite images having high resolution. This work focuses on estimating a particular pixel in the image is an element of a road or not using an enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach. The advent of various frameworks of CNN has made this work realistic. The work proposes a new approach for making data sets for this complex problem and has concluded with a feasible solution for the problem. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

This kind of technology gradually increased from a conventional man controlled car to a self-sufficient vehicle. Collision avoidance and Traffic optimizations are the further explorations of prospective in Intelligent Transport System. The wide spread of information and efficient information between vehicles is important aspects of all the ITS applications. This can happen through a simple and efficient method called Distance Defer Transmission (DDT) which is a part of Multi-hop dissemination. The transmission ranges with different transmission power values are generally heterogeneous. The spreading of information should stop before it reaches the required region and this is considered as a main problem. The Area Defer Scheme (ADT) can avoid this problem using original road maps with complicated road scheme and real movement traces. DDT scheme can also be compared with this scheme. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

A web application may be a single page HTML website or a large web portal that offers various services on a web browser. There are many tools and methodologies that are relied upon to develop a web application. The development methodologies incorporate specialized frameworks, libraries in order to have the application more standardized and have it developed at a rapid pace to meet market demands. Web applications (web app) are hardened to mitigate security issues which are commonly referred as web application vulnerabilities. A web app security vulnerability is any kind of loop hole that allows an attacker to break into the web application to perform undesired actions on the target website. This may range from a cross site scripting (XSS) to vulnerabilities like Server Side Request Forger (SSRF) and its implications like XML External Entity (XXE). Though web applications are hardened to mitigate vulnerabilities, large scale web applications are still vulnerable post release in most cases. As a part of security research, critical vulnerabilities on large scale web applications were identified and the same were reported to the concerned security research team. The reporting was acknowledged and mitigated through appropriate channels. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were filed on Microsoft and CISCO products and the same were logged in National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Insights and tenets regarding web application and its vulnerabilities are highlighted in this manuscript. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Pristine and degraded devices have been characterized in terms of I-V curves and Impedance Spectroscopy (IS). After two months, the efficiency drops from 2.83 % to 2.55 % for devices kept in dark conditions, and to 0.85 % for devices placed outdoor. Impedance spectra, measured before and after degradation have been fitted with an equivalent circuit that models recombination and diffusion processes. The evolution of the circuital parameters obtained from the IS fit show that devices degraded outside present i) a significant increase of the transport resistance, which hinders charge conduction, and ii) a decrease of majority carrier mobility, which is related to a loss of the blend crystallinity. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The connection between the Klein tunneling times of electrons and cut-off frequencies of graphene devices is not obvious. We argue in this paper that the trajectory-based Bohmian approach gives a very natural framework to quantify Klein tunneling times because of its ability to distinguish, not only between transmitted and reflected electrons, but also between reflected electrons that spend time in the barrier and those that do not. In particular, we study Klein tunneling times for electrons in a two-terminal graphene device constituted by a potential barrier between two metallic contacts. The main conclusion of this work is that the high graphene mobility is roughly independent of the presence of Klein tunneling phenomena in the active device region. Finally, the connection between transit (tunneling) times and cut-off frequencies in electronic devices is discussed. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

        "abstract": "Sarcasm is a sophisticated form of sentiment expression where speaker express their opinions opposite of what they mean. Sarcasm detection and Emotion detection from social net-working sites has been a great field of study. With the growth of e-services such as e-commerce, e-tourism and e-business, the companies are very keen on exploiting emotion and sarcasm analysis for their marketing strategies in order to evaluate the public attitudes towards their brand. Thus efficient emotion and sarcasm modeling system can be a good solution to the above problem. This work aims at developing a system that groups posts based on emotions, sentiment and find sarcastic posts, if present. The proposed system is to develop a prototype that help to come to an inference about the emotions of the posts namely anger, surprise, happy, fear, sorrow, trust, anticipation and disgust with three sentic levels in each. This helps in better understanding of the posts when compared to the approaches which senses the polarity of the posts and gives just their sentiments i.e., positive, negative or neutral. The posts handling these emotions might be sarcastic too. The Sentiment emotion identification module identifies the sentiment or emotion of the post by evaluating score of each word in the comment which is used by different sarcasm detection methods to detect sarcasm. The emotion identification module uses the lexical databases WordNet, SentiWordNet to find the right sentiment scores for the words with respect to each emotion. It also uses Sarcasm detection algorithms like Emoticon sarcasm detection, Hybrid sarcasm detection, Hashtag Processing, Interjection Word Start (IWT). \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

In particular, voltage fluctuations might cause large losses of generation via DER operation/interconnection compliance. To understand orchestral DER dynamics, a first step is to determine the influence of a disturbance on the overall bulk power system. This work introduces metrics that allow for the classification and comparison of a variety of system faults with respect to their influences on voltage profiles. These metrics are applied to standardized fault simulations on the Western Interconnection Paths with a full-scale Positive Sequence Load Flow model. The results are presented with a highlight on Path 61, which has the potential for DER generation reduction exceeding the current credible contingency of a double Palo Verde loss. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

The driven loop element has two semi loops, one is designed above the substrate and other bellow the substrate, which increase the bandwidth of antenna and reduces dimensio of the antenna. The proposed quasi-Yagi MIMO antenna system has been designed to operate at the desired center frequency of 4.9 GHz which has a specific application of public safety WLAN. The MIMO antenna has bandwidth of 2.75 GHz in the range of 4.49-7.24 GHz. It has a miniaturized size of 52\u00d7 80\u00d7 0.2 mm3. The Yagi like MIMO antenna has high directional radiation characteristics with the simulated isolation of more than 18 dB, gain of 4.68 dB and a directivity of 5.37 dBi at 4.9 GHz. It has a simulated envelop correlation coefficient (ECC) value of 5.15\u00d7 10-6 across the frequency band. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",

Various converters are used in the DC bus with proper power conditioning through different control strategies. A direct driven permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) based wind energy system (WES) and Photovoltaic (PV) systems are implemented as energy sources. To enhance the efficiency of the system and to capture maximum power from the system, Hill climb search (HCS) algorithm and incremental conductance (IC) methods are used for WES and PV system respectively. Battery is used as an energy storage device in this islanded DC microgrid to reduce intermittent fluctuation and improves reliability in PV/Wind system due to varying atmospheric conditions. A 16 kW PV/wind system under DC microgrid is simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink. Performance analysis shows that the system is feasible and can be utilized in rural/remote areas more efficiently. \u00a9 2018 IEEE.",
